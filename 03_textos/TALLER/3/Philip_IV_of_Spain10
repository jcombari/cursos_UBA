Early in his reign, Philip would be woken by Olivares in the morning to discuss the day's affairs[17] and would meet with him twice more during the day, although later this routine declined until the king would hold only one short meeting on policy with Olivares each day.[18] Philip intervened far more in policies during 1641–42, however, and it has been suggested that Philip paid more attention to policymaking than has traditionally been depicted; some recent histories go so far as to describe him as 'conscientious' in policymaking,[7] although he is still criticised for his failure to make timely decisions.[20] Philip himself argued that it was hardly appropriate for the king himself to go house to house amongst his ministers to see if his instructions were being carried out.[21] The close relationship between Philip and Olivares was demonstrated by their portraits' being placed side by side at the Buen Retiro palace — an act unheard-of in Europe at the time.[22] Philip's relationship with Olivares, however, was not a simplistic one. The pair had many rows and arguments over the course of their relationship, both as a result of their different personalities and differences of opinion over policies.[23]
