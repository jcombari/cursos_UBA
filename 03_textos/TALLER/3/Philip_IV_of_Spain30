The 'Planet King' also invested in a new palace to display both his art and the ritual of court. Through Olivares, Philip commenced the building of the Buen Retiro palace in Madrid, parts of which still remain near the Prado. Work began modestly in 1631,[66] with the magnificent, if costly, 'Hall of Thrones', completed by 1635.[4] The palace included its own 'theatre, ballroom, galleries, bull ring, gardens, and artificial lakes',[65] and became the centre for artists and dramatists from across Europe. The palace was built during one of the more difficult periods of Philip's reign. Given both its cost, in a time of stringent wartime savings, and the protest that ensued from a disgruntled public,[67] it is considered to have been an important part of the attempt to communicate royal grandeur and authority.[by whom?]
