In 1666, Isaac Newton argued that the faults of the refracting telescope were fundamental because the lens refracted light of different colors differently. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations.[113] From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope.[114] However, he was able to demonstrate that the angle of reflection remained the same for all colors, so he decided to build a reflecting telescope.[115] It was completed in 1668 and is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.[116]
