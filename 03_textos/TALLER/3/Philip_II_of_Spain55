Acts making it high treason to deny Philip's royal authority were passed in Ireland[44] and England.[45] Philip and Mary appeared on coins together, with a single crown suspended between them as a symbol of joint reign. The Great Seal shows Philip and Mary seated on thrones, holding the crown together.[41] The coat of arms of England was impaled with Philip's to denote their joint reign.[46][47] During their joint reign, they waged war against France, which resulted in the loss of Calais, England's last remaining possession in France.
