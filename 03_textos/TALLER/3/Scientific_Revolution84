Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) invented the mechanical calculator in 1642.[101] The introduction of his Pascaline in 1645 launched the development of mechanical calculators first in Europe and then all over the world.[102][103] Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), building on Pascal's work, became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators; he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator, in 1685,[104] and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, foundation of virtually all modern computer architectures.[105]
