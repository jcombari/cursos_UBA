In the winter of 1532, Henry met with Francis I at Calais and enlisted the support of the French king for his new marriage.[73] Immediately upon returning to Dover in England, Henry, now 41, and Anne went through a secret wedding service.[74] She soon became pregnant, and there was a second wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer, sitting in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the king's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void.  Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be valid.[75] Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen, becoming instead "princess dowager" as the widow of Arthur. In her place, Anne was crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533.[76] The queen gave birth to a daughter slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533.  The child was christened Elizabeth, in honour of Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York.[77]
