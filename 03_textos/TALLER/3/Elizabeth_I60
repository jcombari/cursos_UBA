Trade and diplomatic relations developed between England and the Barbary states during the rule of Elizabeth.[153][154] England established a trading relationship with Morocco in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, in spite of a Papal ban.[155] In 1600, Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud, the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur, visited England as an ambassador to the court of Queen Elizabeth I,[153][156] to negotiate an Anglo-Moroccan alliance against Spain.[157][153] Elizabeth "agreed to sell munitions supplies to Morocco, and she and Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the Spanish".[158] Discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy.[159]
