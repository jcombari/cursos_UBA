Marriage negotiations constituted a key element in Elizabeth's foreign policy.[74] She turned down Philip's hand early in 1559 but for several years entertained the proposal of King Eric XIV of Sweden.[75] For several years she also seriously negotiated to marry Philip's cousin Archduke Charles of Austria. By 1569, relations with the Habsburgs had deteriorated. Elizabeth considered marriage to two French Valois princes in turn, first Henry, Duke of Anjou, and later, from 1572 to 1581, his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, formerly Duke of Alen√ßon.[76] This last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against Spanish control of the Southern Netherlands.[77] Elizabeth seems to have taken the courtship seriously for a time, and wore a frog-shaped earring that Anjou had sent her.[78]
