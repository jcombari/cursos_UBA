Catherine is often credited with the introduction of tea drinking to Britain, although Samuel Pepys makes reference to drinking tea for the first time in his diary entry for 25 September 1660, prior to Catherine's emigration to England and marriage to Charles. It is more likely that she popularised the drink, which was unusual in Britain at the time.[13][14] Beyond tea, her arrival brought and promulgated goods such as cane, lacquer, cottons, and porcelain.[15]
