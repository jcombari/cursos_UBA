Cromwell did much work through his many offices to remove the tasks of government from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the King) and into a public state.[183] But he did so in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants, not least because he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, and the possibility of actually achieving the plan he set out.[184] Cromwell made the various income streams Henry VII put in place more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration.[185] The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor.[186] A difference emerged between the king's financial health and the country's, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required him to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances.[187] Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539.[188] He was executed on 28 July 1540.[189]
