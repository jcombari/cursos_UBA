The Spanish had different goals in their exploration of the land than the other European powers. They came to make a fortune and take it back home to Spain while never having the intention to stay and create a new life. They had three goals for exploration: “Conquer, convert, or become rich”.[7] The Spanish justified their claims to the New World based on the Ideals of the Reconquista.[8] They saw their reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula out from the Moor's control as evidence of the “divine help". They believed it to be their duty to save the natives from eternal damnation by converting them to Christianity. In 1431 the first Spaniard had finally became Pope and Spain justified their right to implement Christianity throughout the world.[9]
