In the spring of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth was in love with her childhood friend Robert Dudley.[62] It was said that Amy Robsart, his wife, was suffering from a "malady in one of her breasts" and that the Queen would like to marry Dudley if his wife should die.[63] By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth's hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her favourite was not welcome in England:[64] "There is not a man who does not cry out on him and her with indignationÂ ... she will marry none but the favoured Robert."[65] Amy Dudley died in September 1560, from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the coroner's inquest finding of accident, many people suspected Dudley of having arranged her death so that he could marry the queen.[66] Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time. However, William Cecil, Nicholas Throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear.[67] There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.[68]
