Throughout the South American hemisphere, there were three large regional sources of populations: Native Americans,  arriving Europeans, and forcibly transported Africans. The mixture of these cultures impacted the ethnic makeup that predominates in the hemisphere's largely independent states today. The term to describe someone of mixed European and indigenous ancestry is mestizo while the term to describe someone of mixed European and African ancestry is mulatto. The mestizo and mulatto population are specific to Iberian influenced current day Latin America because the conquistadors had (often forced) sexual relations with the indigenous and African women.[57] The social interaction of these three groups of people inspired the creation of a caste system based on skin tone. The hierarchy centered around those with the lightest skin tone and ordered from highest to lowest was the Spanish, mestizo, indigenous, mulatto, then African.[9]
