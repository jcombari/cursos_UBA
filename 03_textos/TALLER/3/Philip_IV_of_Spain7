Privately, Philip appears to have had a lighter persona. When he was younger, he was said to have a keen sense of humor and a 'great sense of fun'.[8] He privately attended 'academies' in Madrid throughout his reign â€“ these were lighthearted literary salons, aiming to analyze contemporary literature and poetry with a humorous touch.[9] A keen theatre-goer, he was sometimes criticized by contemporaries for his love of these 'frivolous' entertainments.[10] Others have captured his private personality as 'naturally kind, gentle and affable'.[11] Those close to him claimed he was academically competent, with a good grasp of Latin and geography, and could speak French, Portuguese and Italian well.[12] Like many of his contemporaries, including Olivares, he had a keen interest in astrology.[13] His handwritten translation of Francesco Guicciardini's texts on political history still exist.
