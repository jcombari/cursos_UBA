Having considered the matter, Cromwell suggested Anne, the 25-year-old sister of the Duke of Cleves, who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England, for the duke fell between Lutheranism and Catholicism.[115] Hans Holbein the Younger was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the king.[116] Despite speculation that Holbein painted her in an overly flattering light, it is more likely that the portrait was accurate; Holbein remained in favour at court.[117] After seeing Holbein's portrait, and urged on by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers, the 49-year-old king agreed to wed Anne.[118] However, it was not long before Henry wished to annul the marriage so he could marry another.[119][120] Anne did not argue, and confirmed that the marriage had never been consummated.[121] Anne's previous betrothal to the Duke of Lorraine's son Francis provided further grounds for the annulment.[122] The marriage was subsequently dissolved, and Anne received the title of "The King's Sister", two houses and a generous allowance.[121] It was soon clear that Henry had fallen for the 17-year-old Catherine Howard, the Duke of Norfolk's niece, the politics of which worried Cromwell, for Norfolk was a political opponent.[123]
