The period after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new difficulties for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign.[133] The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and the standard of living fell.[165][166][133] During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders.[167] To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda.[165] In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her.[168][169]
