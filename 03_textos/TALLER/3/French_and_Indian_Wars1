The French and Indian Wars were a series of conflicts that occurred in North America between 1688 and 1763, some of which indirectly were related to the European dynastic wars. The title French and Indian War in the singular is used in the United States specifically for the warfare of 1754â€“63, which is mostly coincident with the Seven Years' War. The French and Indian Wars were preceded by the Beaver Wars.
