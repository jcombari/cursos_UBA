In 1538, in the Treaty of Nagyv치rad, Ferdinand induced the childless Z치polya to name him as his successor. But in 1540, just before his death, Z치polya had a son, John II Sigismund, who was promptly elected King by the Diet. Ferdinand invaded Hungary, but the regent, Frater George Martinuzzi, Bishop of V치rad, called on the Ottomans for protection. Suleiman marched into Hungary (see Siege of Buda (1541)) and not only drove Ferdinand out of central Hungary, he forced Ferdinand to agree to pay tribute for his lands in western Hungary.[13]
