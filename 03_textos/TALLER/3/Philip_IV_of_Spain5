Perceptions of Philip's personality have altered considerably over time. Victorian authors were inclined to portray him as a weak individual, delegating excessively to his ministers, and ruling over a debauched Baroque court.[4] Victorian historians even attributed the early death of Baltasar to debauchery, encouraged by the gentlemen entrusted by the king with his education. The doctors who treated the Prince at that time in fact diagnosed smallpox, although modern scholars attribute his death to appendicitis.[citation needed] Historians' estimation of Philip gradually improved in the 20th century, with comparisons between Philip and his father being increasingly positive â€“ some noting that he possessed much more energy, both mental and physical, than his diffident father.[5]
