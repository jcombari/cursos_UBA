The English naval commander Francis Drake sailed along the coast in 1579 north of Cabrillo's landing site while circumnavigating the world.  On 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at South Cove, Cape Arago, just south of Coos Bay, Oregon, and then sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship. [139][140][141][142][143] On 17 June, Drake and his crew found a protected cove when they landed on the Pacific coast of what is now Northern California near Point Reyes. [144][145] While ashore, he claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I as Nova Albion or New Albion. [146] To document and assert his claim, Drake posted an engraved plate of brass to claim sovereignty for Elizabeth and every successive English monarch. [147]
