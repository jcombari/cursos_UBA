In 1631, "Heavy Troops" that could build and operate European-style cannon,[38] The imported cannons in the Qing Dynasty had a high reputation such as 'Great General in Red'.[39] The Manchu elite did not concern themselves directly with guns and their production, preferring instead to delegate the task to Han-Chinese craftsmen, who produced for the Qing a similar composite metal cannon known as the "Shenwei grand general."[40][41] Cannons and muskets are also widely used in wars known as 'Ten Great Campaigns'.[42][43] However, after the Qing gained hegemony over East Asia in the mid-18th century, the practice of casting composite metal cannons fell into disuse until the dynasty faced external threats once again in the Opium War of 1840, at which point smoothbore cannons were already starting to become obsolete as a result of rifled barrels.[41]
