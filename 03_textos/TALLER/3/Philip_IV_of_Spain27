Philip has been remembered both for the 'astonishing enthusiasm' with which he collected art[60] and for his love of theatre. On the stage, he favoured Lope de Vega, Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, and other distinguished dramatists. Philip has been credited with a share in the composition of several comedies. Court theatre used perspective scenery, a new invention from Italy not used in commercial theatre at the time. Some writers have likened the illusion of Baroque royal theatre to the illusion of kingly power the performances were designed to reinforce.[61] Some recent scholarship has suggested that Philip's financial sponsorship of playwrights, however, may have been less extensive than once thought.[15]
