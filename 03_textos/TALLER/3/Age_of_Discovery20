A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing Eurasia by land in the late Middle Ages.[22] Although the Mongols had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,[clarification needed] Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the Pax Mongolica allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.[23][24] A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the Maritime republics.[citation needed] The close Italian links to the Levant raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.[25][pageÂ needed]
