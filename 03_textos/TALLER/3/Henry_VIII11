Although Henry's marriage to Catherine has since been described as "unusually good",[30] it is known that Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, either Elizabeth or Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon.[31] The most significant mistress for about three years, starting in 1516, was Elizabeth Blount.[29] Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses, considered by some to be few for a virile young king.[32][33] Exactly how many Henry had is disputed: David Loades believes Henry had mistresses "only to a very limited extent",[33] whilst Alison Weir believes there were numerous other affairs.[34] There is no evidence that Catherine protested, and in 1518 she fell pregnant again with another girl, who was also stillborn.[29] Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henry's illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy.[29] The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation.[35] In 1533, FitzRoy married Mary Howard, but died childless three years later.[36] At the time of Richmond's death in June 1536, Parliament was enacting the Second Succession Act, which could have allowed him to become king.[37]
