The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.[11]  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.[10]:351â€“2 The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.[10]:382  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.  The compass card was also a European invention.[10]
