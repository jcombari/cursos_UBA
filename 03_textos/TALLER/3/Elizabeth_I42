Mary was soon the focus for rebellion. In 1569 there was a major Catholic rising in the North; the goal was to free Mary, marry her to Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and put her on the English throne.[105] After the rebels' defeat, over 750 of them were executed on Elizabeth's orders.[106] In the belief that the revolt had been successful, Pope Pius V issued a bull in 1570, titled Regnans in Excelsis, which declared "Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime" to be excommunicated and a heretic, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her.[107][108] Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with excommunication.[107] The papal bull provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth's intervention.[109] In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with "the intent" to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty.[110] From the 1570s missionary priests from continental seminaries went to England secretly in the cause of the "reconversion of England".[108] Many suffered execution, engendering a cult of martyrdom.[108]
