In 1587, a young man calling himself Arthur Dudley was arrested on the coast of Spain under suspicion of being a spy.[91] The man claimed to be the illegitimate son of Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, with his age being consistent with birth during the 1561 illness.[92] He was taken to Madrid for investigation, where he was examined by Francis Englefield, a Catholic aristocrat exiled to Spain and secretary to King Philip II.[91] Three letters exist today describing the interview, detailing what Arthur proclaimed to be the story of his life, from birth in the royal palace to the time of his arrival in Spain.[91] However, this failed to convince the Spanish: Englefield admitted to the King that Arthur's "claim at present amounts to nothing", but suggested that "he should not be allowed to get away, but [...] kept very secure."[92] The King agreed, and Arthur was never heard from again.[93] Modern scholarship dismisses the story's basic premise as "impossible",[92] and asserts that Elizabeth's life was so closely observed by contemporaries that she could not have hidden a pregnancy.[93][94]
