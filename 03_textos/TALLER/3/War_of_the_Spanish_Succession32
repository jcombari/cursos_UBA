Victor Amadeus II allied with France in 1701 but his long-term goal was the acquisition of Milan; neither France, Austria, or Spain would relinquish this voluntarily, leaving Britain as the only power that could. After the Royal Navy established control over the Western Mediterranean in 1703, Savoy changed sides. During 1704, the French captured Villefranche and the County of Savoy, accompanied by an offensive in Piedmont; by the end of 1705, Victor Amadeus controlled only his capital of Turin.[36]
