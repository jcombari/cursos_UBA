Henry's break with Rome incurred the threat of a large-scale French or Spanish invasion.[86] To guard against this, in 1538 he began to build a chain of expensive, state-of-the-art defences along Britain's southern and eastern coasts, from Kent to Cornwall, largely built of material gained from the demolition of the monasteries.[224] These were known as Henry VIII's Device Forts. He also strengthened existing coastal defence fortresses such as Dover Castle and, at Dover, Moat Bulwark and Archcliffe Fort, which he visited for a few months to supervise.[86] Wolsey had many years before conducted the censuses required for an overhaul of the system of militia, but no reform resulted.[225] In 1538â€“39, Cromwell overhauled the shire musters, but his work mainly served to demonstrate how inadequate they were in organisation.[86] The building works, including that at Berwick, along with the reform of the militias and musters, were eventually finished under Queen Mary.[226]
