The day after Anne's execution in 1536 the 45-year-old Henry became engaged to Seymour, who had been one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting. They were married ten days later[106] at the Palace of Whitehall, Whitehall, London, in the Queen's closet by Bishop Gardiner.[107] On 12 October 1537, Jane gave birth to a son, Prince Edward, the future Edward VI.[108] The birth was difficult, and the queen died on 24 October 1537 from an infection and was buried in Windsor.[109] The euphoria that had accompanied Edward's birth became sorrow, but it was only over time that Henry came to long for his wife. At the time, Henry recovered quickly from the shock.[110] Measures were immediately put in place to find another wife for Henry, which, at the insistence of Cromwell and the court, were focused on the European continent.[111]
