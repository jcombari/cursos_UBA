The European colonization of the Americas describes the Age of Exploration and the resulting conquest and establishment of Western European control in what is now considered North and South America. Europe had been preoccupied with internal wars and was slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the Black Death; thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th century.[1] European colonization impacted the political systems, geographic boundaries, and languages that predominate in the hemisphere's largely independent states today.
