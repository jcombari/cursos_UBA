The battle started before all units were fully deployed. At 4:00Â am on 11 September, the Ottomans attacked, seeking to interfere with the deployment of Holy League troops.[16]:661 The Germans were the first to strike back. Charles of Lorraine moved forward with the imperial army on the left and other imperial forces in the center and, after heavy fighting and multiple Ottoman counterattacks, took several key positions, specifically the fortified villages of Nussdorf and Heiligenstadt. By noon the imperial army had already severely mauled the Ottomans and come close to a breakthrough.[34] Though shattered, the Ottoman army did not crumble at that moment.[35]
