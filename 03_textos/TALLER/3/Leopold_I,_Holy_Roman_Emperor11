An anti-French Quadruple Alliance was formed in August, consisting of the Republic, Spain, Emperor Leopold and the Duke of Lorraine, while in May 1674, the Imperial Diet declared it an Imperial war. The 1678 Treaty of Nijmegen is generally seen as a French victory, although the Alliance succeeded in limiting their gains.[9]
