The 2017 EFL Trophy Final was an association football match that was played on 2 April 2017 at Wembley Stadium, London, between League One teams Coventry City and Oxford United.

The game was played in front of a crowd of 74,434, the highest attendance for the final since the opening of the new Wembley Stadium.
