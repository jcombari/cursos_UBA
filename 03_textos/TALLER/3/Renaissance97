The term Renaissance has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries. Charles H. Haskins (1870â€“1937), for example, made a case for a Renaissance of the 12th century.[137] Other historians have argued for a Carolingian Renaissance in the 8th and 9th centuries, Ottonian Renaissance in the 10th century and for the Timurid Renaissance of the 14th century. The Islamic Golden Age has been also sometimes termed with the Islamic Renaissance.[138]
