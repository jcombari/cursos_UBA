Henry is traditionally cited as one of the founders of the Royal Navy.[227] Technologically, Henry invested in large cannon for his warships, an idea that had taken hold in other countries, to replace the smaller serpentines in use.[227] He also flirted with designing ships personally. His contribution to larger vessels, if any, is unknown, but it is believed that he influenced the design of rowbarges and similar galleys.[228] Henry was also responsible for the creation of a permanent navy, with the supporting anchorages and dockyards.[227] Tactically, Henry's reign saw the Navy move away from boarding tactics to employ gunnery instead.[229] The Tudor navy was enlarged up to 50 ships (the Mary Rose among them), and Henry was responsible for the establishment of the "council for marine causes" to oversee the maintenance and operation of the Navy, becoming the basis for the later Admiralty.[230]
