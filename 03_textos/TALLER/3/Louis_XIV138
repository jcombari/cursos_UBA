Nonetheless, Louis has also received praise. The anti-Bourbon Napoleon described him not only as "a great king", but also as "the only King of France worthy of the name".[121] Leibniz, the German Protestant philosopher, commended him as "one of the greatest kings that ever was".[122] And Lord Acton admired him as "by far the ablest man who was born in modern times on the steps of a throne".[123] The historian and philosopher Voltaire wrote: "His name can never be pronounced without respect and without summoning the image of an eternally memorable age".[124] Voltaire's history, The Age of Louis XIV, named Louis' reign as not only one of the four great ages in which reason and culture flourished, but the greatest ever.[125][126]
