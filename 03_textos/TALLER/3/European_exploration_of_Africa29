The West India Company conquered Elmina in 1637 and Luanda in 1640.  In 1648, they were expelled from Luanda by the Portuguese. Overall the Dutch built 16 forts in different places, including Gor√©e in Senegal, partly overtaking Portugal as the main slave-trading power. The Dutch Gold Coast and Dutch Slave Coast were successful.
