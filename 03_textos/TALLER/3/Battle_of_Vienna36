Mustafa Pasha launched his counterattacks with most of his force, but held back some of the elite Janissary and Sipahi units for a simultaneous assault on the city. The Ottoman commanders had intended to take Vienna before Sobieski arrived, but time ran out. Their sappers had prepared a large, final detonation under the LÃ¶belbastei[36] to breach the walls. In total, ten mines were set to explode, but they were located by the defenders and disarmed.
