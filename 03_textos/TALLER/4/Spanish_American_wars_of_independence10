Political independence was not necessarily the foreordained outcome of the political turmoil in Spanish America. "There was little interest in outright independence."[10] As historians R.A. Humphreys and John Lynch note, "it is all too easy to equate the forces of discontent or even the forces of change with the forces of revolution."[11]  Since "by definition, there was no history of independence until it happened,"[12] when Spanish American independence did occur, explanations for why it came about have been sought. The Latin American Wars of Independence were essentially led by European diaspora against European empires.
