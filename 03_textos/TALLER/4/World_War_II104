Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded.[336] Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.[337][338][339]
Many of the civilians died because of deliberate genocide, massacres, mass bombings, disease, and starvation.
