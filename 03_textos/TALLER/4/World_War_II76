On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland, following Italy's armistice with the Allies.[230] Germany with the help of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,[231] and creating a series of defensive lines.[232] German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic,[233] causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.[234]
