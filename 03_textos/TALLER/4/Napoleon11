When he turned 9 years old,[18][19] he moved to the French mainland and enrolled at a religious school in Autun in January 1779. In May, he transferred with a scholarship to a military academy at Brienne-le-Château.[20] In his youth he was an outspoken Corsican nationalist and supported the state's independence from France.[better source needed][18] Like many Corsicans, Napoleon spoke and read Corsican (as his mother tongue) and Italian (as the official language of Corsica).[21][22][23] He began learning French in school at around age 10.[24] Although he became fluent in French, he spoke with a distinctive Corsican accent and never learned how to spell French correctly.[25] He was, however, not an isolated case, as it was estimated in 1790 that fewer than 3 million people, out of France's population of 28 million, were able to speak standard French, and those who could write it were even fewer.[26]
