The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change. Once again the East Berlin communists attempted to disrupt the Berlin municipal elections (as they had done in the 1946 elections),[108] which were held on 5 December 1948 and produced a turnout of 86.3% and an overwhelming victory for the non-communist parties.[114] The results effectively divided the city into East and West versions of its former self. 300,000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue,[115] and US Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen created "Operation Vittles", which supplied candy to German children.[116] In May 1949, Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade.[66][117]
