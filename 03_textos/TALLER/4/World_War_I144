Diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions. In 1914 alone, louse-borne epidemic typhus killed 200,000 in Serbia.[288] From 1918 to 1922, Russia had about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths from epidemic typhus.[289] In 1923, 13 million Russians contracted malaria, a sharp increase from the pre-war years.[290] In addition, a major influenza epidemic spread around the world. Overall, the Spanish flu killed at least 17 million to 50 million people,[12][291][292] including an estimated 2.64 million Europeans and as many as 675,000 Americans.[14] Moreover, between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the world affecting nearly five million people.[293][294]
