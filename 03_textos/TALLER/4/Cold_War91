Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States continued for some time after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Castro during the latter's trip to Washington, DC in April, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place.[195] Cuba began negotiating for arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960.[196] In March of that year Eisenhower gave approval to CIA plans and funding to overthrow Castro.[197]
