While in exile, Napoleon wrote a book about Julius Caesar, one of his great heroes.[205] He also studied English under the tutelage of Count Emmanuel de Las Cases with the main aim of being able to read English newspapers and books, as access to French newspapers and books was heavily restricted to him on Saint Helena.[206]
