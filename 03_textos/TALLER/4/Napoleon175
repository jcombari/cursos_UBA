Critics argue Napoleon's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for France and needless deaths brought by his rule: historian Victor Davis Hanson writes, "After all, the military record is unquestionedâ€”17 years of wars, perhaps six million Europeans dead, France bankrupt, her overseas colonies lost."[305] McLynn states that, "He can be viewed as the man who set back European economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars."[299] Vincent Cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that Napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name, when in fact France was the victim of a series of coalitions which aimed to destroy the ideals of the Revolution.[306]
