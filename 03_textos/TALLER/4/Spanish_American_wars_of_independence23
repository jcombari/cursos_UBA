The Supreme Junta replaced itself with a smaller, five-man council, called the Regency, or the Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies. Next, in order to establish a more legitimate government system, the Regency called for the convening of an "extraordinary and general Cortes of the Spanish Nation": which was convened as the Cortes of Cádiz. The plan for the election of the Cortes, based on provinces, and not kingdoms, was more equitable and provided more time to determine what would be considered an overseas province.[31] The Cortes of Cádiz was the first national assembly to claim sovereignty in Spain.[32] It represented the abolition of the old kingdoms.[33] The opening session was held on 24 September 1810, in the building now known as the Real Teatro de las Cortes under the siege of French army.  It met as one body and its members represented the entire Spanish empire.[34]
