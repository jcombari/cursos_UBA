The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India,[248] and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima.[249] In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July,[249] and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.[250] The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.[251] By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha.[252]
