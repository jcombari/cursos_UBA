The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child.[15] Later in life Napoleon stated, "The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother."[16] Napoleon's maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal Joseph Fesch, would fulfill a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years. Napoleon's noble, moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical Corsican of the time.[17]
