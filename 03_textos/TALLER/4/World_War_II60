The Japanese invasion of Thailand led to Thailand's decision to ally itself with Japan and the other Japanese attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.[170] Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States[171] in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.[125][172]
