The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.[11] A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most post-World WarÂ II issues.[12] No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed.[13]
