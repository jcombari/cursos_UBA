When clergy were required to swear loyalty to the Civil Constitution in November 1790, fewer than 24% did so; the result was a schism with those who refused, the 'non-juring' or 'Refractory clergy'.[69] This stiffened popular resistance against state interference, especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as Normandy, Brittany and the Vend√©e, where only a few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution.[68] Widespread refusal led to further legislation against the clergy, many of whom were forced into exile, deported, or executed.[70]
