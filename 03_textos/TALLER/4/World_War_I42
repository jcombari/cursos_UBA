In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the Battle of Verdun, lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000[99] to 975,000[100] casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice.[101]
