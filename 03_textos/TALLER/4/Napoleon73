The initial military manoeuvres began in September 1806. In a letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ("square battalion").[138] In the bataillon-carré system, the various corps of the Grande Armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance.[138] If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help.[139]
