Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%.[280] France mobilised 7.8 million men, of which 1.4 million died and 3.2 million were injured.[281] 
In Germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease.[282] By the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately 100,000 people in Lebanon.[283] Between 5 and 10 million people died in the Russian famine of 1921.[284] By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922.[285] Numerous anti-Soviet Russians fled the country after the Revolution; by the 1930s, the northern Chinese city of Harbin had 100,000 Russians.[286] Thousands more emigrated to France, England, and the United States.
