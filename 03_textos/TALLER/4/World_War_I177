The Ottoman Empire often treated POWs poorly.[363] Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the Siege of Kut in Mesopotamia in April 1916; 4,250 died in captivity.[364] Although many were in a poor condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march 1,100 kilometres (684Â mi) to Anatolia. A survivor said: "We were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die."[365] The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the Taurus Mountains.
