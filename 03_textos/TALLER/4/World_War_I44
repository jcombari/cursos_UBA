To maintain morale, wartime censors minimised early reports of widespread influenza illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.[104][105] Papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII).[106] This created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit,[107] thereby giving rise to the pandemic's nickname, "Spanish flu".[108]
