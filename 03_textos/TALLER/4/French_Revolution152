French migration to the Canadas was decelerated significantly during, and after the French Revolution; with only a small number of artisans, professionals, and religious emigres from France permitted to settle in the Canadas during that period.[242] Most of these migrants moved to Montreal or Quebec City, although French nobleman Joseph-Genevi√®ve de Puisaye also led a small group of French royalists to settle lands north of York (present day Toronto).[242] The influx of religious migrants from France reinvigorated the Roman Catholic Church in the Canadas, with the refectory priests who moved to the colonies being responsible for the establishment of a number of parishes throughout the Canadas.[242]
