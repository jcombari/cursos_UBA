Axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. The Imperial Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731)[356][357] and in early conflicts against the Soviets.[358] Both the Germans and the Japanese tested such weapons against civilians,[359] and sometimes on prisoners of war.[360]
