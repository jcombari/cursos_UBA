After Reagan's military buildup, the Soviet Union did not respond by further building its military,[315] because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy.[316] At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production,[317] even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production.[Q] These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union as oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues.[304] Issues with command economics,[318] oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.[citation needed]
