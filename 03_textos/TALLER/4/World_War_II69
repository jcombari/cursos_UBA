By mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting. The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad,[200] and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously.[201] By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated,[202] and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk.[203]
