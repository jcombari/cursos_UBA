In 1809, under Napoleon's orders, Pope Pius VII was placed under arrest in Italy, and in 1812 the prisoner Pontiff was transferred to France, being held in the Palace of Fontainebleau.[231] Because the arrest was made in a clandestine manner, some sources[232][231] describe it as a kidnapping. In January 1813, Napoleon personally forced the Pope to sign a humiliating "Concordat of Fontainebleau"[233] which was later repudiated by the Pontiff.[234] The Pope was not released until 1814, when the Coalition invaded France.
