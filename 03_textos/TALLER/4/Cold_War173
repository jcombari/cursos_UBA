"Orthodox" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe.[367] "Revisionist" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II.[367] "Post-revisionists" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War.[367] Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories.[43]
