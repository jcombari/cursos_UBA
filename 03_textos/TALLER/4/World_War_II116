In the East, the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders.[380] Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "inferior people" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass executions.[381] Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East[382] or the West[383] until late 1943.
