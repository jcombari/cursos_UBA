International Napoleonic Congresses take place regularly, with participation by members of the French and American military, French politicians and scholars from different countries.[320] In January 2012, the mayor of Montereau-Fault-Yonne, near Paris—the site of a late victory of Napoleon—proposed development of Napoleon's Bivouac, a commemorative theme park at a projected cost of 200 million euros.[321]
