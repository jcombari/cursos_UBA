The establishment of the modern state of Israel and the roots of the continuing Israeli–Palestinian conflict are partially found in the unstable power dynamics of the Middle East that resulted from World War I.[269] Before the end of the war, the Ottoman Empire had maintained a modest level of peace and stability throughout the Middle East.[270] With the fall of the Ottoman government, power vacuums developed and conflicting claims to land and nationhood began to emerge.[271] The political boundaries drawn by the victors of World War I were quickly imposed, sometimes after only cursory consultation with the local population. These continue to be problematic in the 21st-century struggles for national identity.[272][273] While the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I was pivotal in contributing to the modern political situation of the Middle East, including the Arab-Israeli conflict,[274][275][276] the end of Ottoman rule also spawned lesser known disputes over water and other natural resources.[277]
