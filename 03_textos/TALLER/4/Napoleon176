British military historian Correlli Barnett calls him "a social misfit" who exploited France for his personal megalomaniac goals. He says Napoleon's reputation is exaggerated.[307] French scholar Jean Tulard provided an influential account of his image as a saviour.[308] Louis Bergeron has praised the numerous changes he made to French society, especially regarding the law as well as education.[309] His greatest failure was the Russian invasion. Many historians have blamed Napoleon's poor planning, but Russian scholars instead emphasize the Russian response, noting the notorious winter weather was just as hard on the defenders.[310]
