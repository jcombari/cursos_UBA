Marshal Murat led 120,000 troops into Spain. The French arrived in Madrid on 24 March,[149] where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout Spain. The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bail√©n in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.[citation needed]
