Great Britain had broken the Peace of Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803.[117] In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement became the first step towards the creation of the Third Coalition. By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia.[118] Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.[119]
