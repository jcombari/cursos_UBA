One of the more significant examples of the implementation of containment was US intervention in the Korean War. In June 1950, after years of mutual hostilities,[F][134][135] Kim Il-sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea at the 38th parallel. Stalin had been reluctant to support the invasion[G] but ultimately sent advisers.[136] To Stalin's surprise,[83] the United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 and 83 backed the defense of South Korea, although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest of the fact that Taiwan, not the People's Republic of China, held a permanent seat on the council.[137] A UN force of sixteen countries faced North Korea,[138] although 40 percent of troops were South Korean, and about 50 percent were from the United States.[139]
