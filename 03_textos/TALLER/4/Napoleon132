Napoleon was baptised in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771. He was raised as a Catholic but never developed much faith.[221] As an adult, Napoleon was a deist, believing in an absent and distant God. However, he had a keen appreciation of the power of organized religion in social and political affairs, and he paid a great deal of attention to bending it to his purposes. He noted the influence of Catholicism's rituals and splendors.[221]
