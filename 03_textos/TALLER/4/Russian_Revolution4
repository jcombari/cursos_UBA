The Russian Revolution was a period of political and social revolution across the territory of the Russian Empire, commencing with the abolition of the monarchy in 1917 and concluding in 1923 with the Bolshevik establishment of the Soviet Union at the end of the Civil War. It began during the First World War, with the February Revolution that was focused in and around the then-capital, Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). The revolution erupted in the context of Russia's major military losses during the war, which resulted in much of the Russian Army being ready to mutiny. In the chaos, members of the Duma, Russia's parliament, assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government. This was dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the Russian nobility and aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, and Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne. Grassroots community assemblies called "Soviets", which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial proletariat, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias.
