The regalist and secularizing policies of the Bourbon monarchy were aimed at decreasing the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The crown had already expelled the Jesuits in 1767, which saw many creole members of the Society of Jesus go into permanent exile. By limiting the power of the Church, the crown attempted to centralize itself within the institutions of colonial Latin America. Because of the physical and ideological proximity that the clergy had,[15] they could directly influence and dictate the interactions between populations of colonial Latin America, either as legal counsel or an advisor;[16] a directness which the crown would need to attempt to create the centralized, colonial state which it wanted to implement.
