During the opening stages of World War II, the Soviet Union laid the foundation for the Eastern Bloc by invading and then annexing several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics, by agreement with Germany in the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact. These included eastern Poland (incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR),[55] Latvia (which became the Latvian SSR),[56][57] Estonia (which became the Estonian SSR),[56][57] Lithuania (which became the Lithuanian SSR),[56][57] part of eastern Finland (which became the Karelo-Finnish SSR) and eastern Romania (which became the Moldavian SSR).[58]
