There are various interpretations of the Terror and the violence with which it was conducted; Marxist historian Albert Soboul saw it as essential to defend the Revolution from external and internal threats. Fran√ßois Furet argues the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries and their utopian goals required the extermination of any opposition.[122] A middle position suggests violence was not inevitable but the product of a series of complex internal events, exacerbated by war.[123]
