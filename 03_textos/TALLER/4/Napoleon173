Napoleon ended lawlessness and disorder in post-Revolutionary France.[298] He was considered a tyrant and usurper by his opponents.[299] His critics[who?] charge that he was not troubled when faced with the prospect of war and death for thousands, turned his search for undisputed rule into a series of conflicts throughout Europe and ignored treaties and conventions alike. His role in the Haitian Revolution and decision to reinstate slavery in France's overseas colonies are controversial and affect his reputation.[300]
