The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.[321] The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany in the years 1945â€“1948.[322] Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years.[323][324]
