Protracted action at Verdun throughout 1916,[109] combined with the bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts using frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French and led to the widespread French Army Mutinies, after the failure of the costly Nivelle Offensive of Aprilâ€“May 1917.[110] The concurrent British Battle of Arras was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value.[111][112] A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps, became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada.[113][114]
