On 10 June, Siey√®s moved that the Third Estate proceed to verify its own deputies, and invite the other two to do the same and not wait. This process[clarification needed] was complete on 17 June. By 19 June, the Third Estate was joined by over 100 members of the clergy, and these deputies declared themselves the National Assembly. The remaining deputies from the other two Estates were invited to join, but the Assembly made it clear they intended to legislate with or without their support.[39]
