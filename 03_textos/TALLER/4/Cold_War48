All major powers engaged in espionage, using a great variety of spies, double agents, and new technologies such as the tapping of telephone cables.[98] The most famous and active organizations were the American CIA,[99] the Soviet KGB,[100] and the British MI6. The East German Stasi, unlike the others, was primarily concerned with internal security, but its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance operated espionage activities around the world.[101] The CIA secretly subsidized and promoted anti-communist cultural activities and organizations.[102] The CIA was also involved in European politics, especially in Italy.[103] Espionage took place all over the world, but Berlin was the most important battleground for spying activity.[104]
