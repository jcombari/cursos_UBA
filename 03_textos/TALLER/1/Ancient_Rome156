A genetic study published in Science in November 2019 examined the genetic history of Rome from the Mesolithic up to modern times.[252] The Mesolithic inhabitants of Rome were determined to be Western Hunter Gatherers (WHGs), who were almost entirely replaced by Early European Farmers (EEFs) around 6,000 BC coming from Anatolia and the Fertile Crescent.[253] However, the authors observe that the EEF farmers studied carry a small amount of another component that is found at high levels in Neolithic Iranian farmers and Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHG),[254] suggesting different or additional population contributions from Near Eastern farmers during the Neolithic transition, according to the authors.
