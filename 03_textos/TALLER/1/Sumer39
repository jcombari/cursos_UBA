Following an Elamite invasion and sack of Ur during the rule of Ibbi-Sin (c. 2028â€“2004 BC)[citation needed], Sumer came under Amorite rule (taken to introduce the Middle Bronze Age). The independent Amorite states of the 20th to 18th centuries are summarized as the "Dynasty of Isin" in the Sumerian king list, ending with the rise of Babylonia under Hammurabi c. 1800 BC.
