The Romans gradually subdued the other peoples on the Italian peninsula, including the Etruscans.[30] The last threat to Roman hegemony in Italy came when Tarentum, a major Greek colony, enlisted the aid of Pyrrhus of Epirus in 281Â BC, but this effort failed as well.[31][30] The Romans secured their conquests by founding Roman colonies in strategic areas, thereby establishing stable control over the region of Italy they had conquered.[30]
