Based on remarks by Plutarch,[130] Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from epilepsy. Modern scholarship is sharply divided on the subject, and some scholars believe that he was plagued by malaria, particularly during the Sullan proscriptions of the 80s.[131] Other scholars contend his epileptic seizures were due to a parasitic infection in the brain by a tapeworm.[132][133]
