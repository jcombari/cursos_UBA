Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[146][147] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of steppe ancestry, which is derived from pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic-Caspian steppe during late Neolithic and early Bronze Age.[148] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[143][144][145] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[149] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[143][149] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[150] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[151] There appears to have been significant gene flow between among Celts of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[152] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[153][154]
