The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially Athenian.[247] The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largely Attic-based "koine", or "common" Greek dialect.[248] Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming the lingua franca of Hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern Greek.[248] Furthermore, town planning, education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic.[244] Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century.[249]
