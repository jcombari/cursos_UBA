Notwithstanding its impressive resistance, Carthage's defeat was ultimately a foregone conclusion, given the far larger size and strength of the Roman Republic. Though it was the smallest of the Punic Wars, the third war was to be the most decisive: The complete destruction of the city of Carthage,[112] the annexation of all remaining Carthaginian territory by Rome,[113] and the death or enslavement of tens of thousands of Carthaginians.[114][115] The war ended Carthage's independent existence, and consequently eliminated the last Phoenician political power.[116]
