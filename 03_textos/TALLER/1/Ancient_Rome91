Beginning at age 12, students went to secondary schools, where the teacher (now called a grammaticus) taught them about Greek and Roman literature.[170][173] At the age of 16, some students went on to rhetoric school (where the teacher, usually Greek, was called a rhetor).[170][173] Education at this level prepared students for legal careers, and required that the students memorize the laws of Rome.[170] Pupils went to school every day, except religious festivals and market days. There were also summer holidays.
