Like most ancient societies, including the Phoenician city-states, Carthage was initially ruled as a monarchy, although modern scholars debate whether this stemmed from a misunderstanding by Greek writers.[120] Traditionally, most Phoenician kings did not exercise absolute power, but consulted with a body of advisors called the Adirim ("mighty ones"), which was likely composed of the wealthiest members of society, namely merchants.[121] Carthage seems to have been ruled by a similar body known as the Blm, made up of nobles responsible for all important matters of state, including religion, administration, and the military.[120] Within this cabal was a hierarchy topped by the dominant family, usually the wealthiest members of the merchant class, which had some sort of executive power. Records indicate that different families held power at different times, suggesting a nonhereditary system of government dependent on the support or approval of the consultative body.[120]
