The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[74] and Bracari[75] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[76]
