Common motifs of the Parthian period include scenes of royal hunting expeditions and the investiture of Arsacid kings.[249] Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers.[247] Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, frescos, and even graffiti.[247] Geometric and stylized plant patterns were also used on stucco and plaster walls.[248] The common motif of the Sasanian period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances first appeared in the Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun.[250]
