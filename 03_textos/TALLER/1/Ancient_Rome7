According to the founding myth of Rome, the city was founded on 21 April 753Â BC on the banks of the river Tiber in central Italy, by the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, who descended from the Trojan prince Aeneas,[11] and who were grandsons of the Latin King Numitor of Alba Longa. King Numitor was deposed by his brother, Amulius, while Numitor's daughter, Rhea Silvia, gave birth to the twins.[12][13] Since Rhea Silvia had been raped and impregnated by Mars, the Roman god of war, the twins were considered half-divine.
