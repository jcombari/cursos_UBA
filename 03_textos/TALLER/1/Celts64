Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[105] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[106] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La TÃ¨ne areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.
