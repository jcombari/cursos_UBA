Classical writers did not apply the terms Κελτοί (Keltoi) or "Celtae" to the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland,[6][7][8] leading a number of scholars to question the use of the term Celt to describe the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[6][7][8][9] The first historical account of the islands of Britain and Ireland was by Pytheas, a Greek from the city of Massalia, who around 310–306 BC, sailed around what he called the "Pretannikai nesoi", which can be translated as the "Pretannic Isles".[100] In general, classical writers referred to the inhabitants of Britain as Pretannoi or Britanni.[101]
Strabo, writing in the Roman era, clearly distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[102]
