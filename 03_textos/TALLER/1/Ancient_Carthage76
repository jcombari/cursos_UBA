Although Carthage was firmly controlled by oligarchs, its government included some democratic elements, including elected legislators, trade unions, town meetings, and a popular assembly.[133] Aristotle claims that, unlike in the Greek republics of Sparta and Crete, if the sufetes and the supreme council could not come to an agreement, an assembly of the people had the deciding vote. It is unclear whether this assembly was ad hoc or a formal institution, but Aristotle claims that "the voice of the people was predominant in the deliberations" and "the people themselves solved problems".[43] Both he and Herodotus state that the Carthaginian government was more meritocratic than even some Hellenistic counterparts, with "great men" like Hamilcar being elected to "royal office" based on "outstanding achievements" and "special merit".[134]
Aristotle also praises Carthage's political system for its "balanced" elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, believing that each element was kept in check by the other two. Aristotle's Athenian contemporary, Isocrates, elevates Carthage's political system as the best in antiquity, equaled only by that of Sparta.[135]
