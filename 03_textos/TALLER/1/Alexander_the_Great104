In 334 BC, Alexander the Great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of Athena Polias in Priene, in modern-day western Turkey.[239][240] An inscription from the temple, now housed in the British Museum, declares: "King Alexander dedicated [this temple] to Athena Polias."[238] This inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from Alexander's life.[238] The temple was designed by Pytheos, one of the architects of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.[238][239][240][241]
