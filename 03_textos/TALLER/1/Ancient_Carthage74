Most political power rested in a council of elders, variably called the supreme council or Adirim, which the Romans compared to their Senate and Aristotle likens to the Spartan Gerousia. The Adirim perhaps numbered thirty members and had a broad range of powers, such as administering the treasury and conducting foreign affairs.[130] During the Second Punic War it reportedly exercised some military power.[130]  Like the sufetes, members of the council were drawn from the wealthiest elements of Carthaginian society. Important matters of state required unanimous agreement between the sufetes and council members.
