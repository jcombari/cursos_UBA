During the sixth century BC, Carthaginian generals became a distinct political office known in Punic as rb mhnt, or rab mahanet.[129] Unlike in other ancient societies. Carthage maintained a separation of military and political power, with generals either appointed by the administration or elected by citizens.[129] Generals did not serve fixed terms but were usually selected based on the length or scale of a war.[164] Initially, the generalship was apparently occupied by two separate but equal offices, such as an army commander and an admiral; by the mid third century, military campaigns were usually carried out by a supreme commander and a deputy.[164] During the Second Punic War, Hannibal appears to have exercised total control over all military affairs, and had up to seven subordinate generals divided along different theaters of war.[164]
