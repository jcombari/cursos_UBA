The Canaanite city state system broke down during the Late Bronze Age collapse,[15] and Canaanite culture was then gradually absorbed into that of the Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelites.[16] The process was gradual[17] and a strong Egyptian presence continued into the 12th centuryÂ BCE, and, while some Canaanite cities were destroyed, others continued to exist in Iron Age I.[18]
