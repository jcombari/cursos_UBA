Antony attempted to strike an alliance with Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, whose relations with Phraates IV had recently soured. This was abandoned when Antony and his forces withdrew from Armenia in 33Â BC; they escaped a Parthian invasion while Antony's rival Octavian attacked his forces to the west.[104] After the defeat and suicides of Antony and Cleopatra in 30 BC,[105] Parthian ally Artaxias II reassumed the throne of Armenia.
