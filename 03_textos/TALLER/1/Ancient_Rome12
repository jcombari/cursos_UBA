The city of Rome grew from settlements around a ford on the river Tiber, a crossroads of traffic and trade.[14] According to archaeological evidence, the village of Rome was probably founded some time in the 8th century BC, though it may go back as far as the 10th century BC, by members of the Latin tribe of Italy, on the top of the Palatine Hill.[18][19]
