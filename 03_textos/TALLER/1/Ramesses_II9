Ramesses's forces were caught in a Hittite ambush and outnumbered at Kadesh when they counterattacked and routed the Hittites, whose survivors abandoned their chariots and swam the Orontes river to reach the safe city walls.[29] Ramesses, logistically unable to sustain a long siege, returned to Egypt.[30][31]
