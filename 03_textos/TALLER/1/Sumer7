These prehistoric people before the Sumerians are now called "proto-Euphrateans" or "Ubaidians",[24] and are theorized to have evolved from the Samarra culture of northern Mesopotamia.[25][26][27][28] The Ubaidians, though never mentioned by the Sumerians themselves, are assumed by modern-day scholars to have been the first civilizing force in Sumer. They drained the marshes for agriculture, developed trade, and established industries, including weaving, leatherwork, metalwork, masonry, and pottery.[24]
