Pilum (spear): The Roman heavy spear was a weapon favored by legionaries and weighed approximately five pounds.[26] The innovated javelin was designed to be used only once and was destroyed upon initial use. This ability prevented the enemy from reusing spears. All soldiers carried two versions of this weapon: a primary spear and a backup. A solid block of wood in the middle of the weapon provided legionaries protection for their hands while carrying the device. According to Polybius, historians have records of "how the Romans threw their spears and then charged with swords".[27] This tactic seemed to be common practice among Roman infantry.
