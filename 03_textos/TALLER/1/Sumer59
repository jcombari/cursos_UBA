During the 3rd millennium BC, a cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism.[31] The mutual influences between Sumerian on Akkadian are evident in all areas including lexical borrowing on a massive scaleâ€”and syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.[31] These influences have prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian of the 3rd millennium BC as a Sprachbund.[31]
