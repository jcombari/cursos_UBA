Over the course of his conquests, Alexander founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most of them east of the Tigris.[106][237] The first, and greatest, was Alexandria in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities.[106] The cities' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons.[106] Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece.[106][237] However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.[106]
