The location of Boudica's defeat is unknown.[43] Some historians favour a site somewhere along the Roman road now known as Watling Street.[44] Kevin K. Carroll suggests a site close to High Cross, Leicestershire, on the junction of Watling Street and the Fosse Way, which would have allowed the Legio II Augusta, based at Exeter, to rendezvous with the rest of Suetonius's forces, had they not failed to do so.[45] Manduessedum (Mancetter), near the modern town of Atherstone in Warwickshire, has also been suggested,[46] and according to legend "The Rampart" near Messing, Essex and Ambresbury Banks in Epping Forest.[47] More recently, a discovery of Roman artefacts in Kings Norton close to Metchley Camp has suggested another possibility,[48] one individual has suggested the Cuttle Mill area of Paulerspury in Northamptonshire,[49] where fragments of Roman pottery from the 1st century have been found.[50]
