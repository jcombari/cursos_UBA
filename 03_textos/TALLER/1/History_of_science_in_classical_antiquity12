Like the Pythagoreans, Plato (c. 427â€“c. 347 BC) found the ordering principle of the universe in mathematics, specifically in geometry.  A later account has it that Plato had inscribed at the entrance to his school, the Academy, "Let no man ignorant of geometry enter."[13]  The story is a myth, but it has a grain of truth, for in his writings Plato repeatedly tells us of the importance of geometry.
