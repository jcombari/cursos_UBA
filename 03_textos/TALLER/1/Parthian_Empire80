Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress, with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry.[266] Their many-folded dresses were fastened by a brooch at one shoulder.[260] Their headdresses also featured a veil which was draped backwards.[260]
