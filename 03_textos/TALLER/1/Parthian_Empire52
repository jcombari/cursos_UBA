Local and foreign written accounts, as well as non-textual artifacts, have been used to reconstruct Parthian history.[169] Although the Parthian court maintained records, the Parthians had no formal study of history; the earliest universal history of Iran, the Khwaday-Namag, was not compiled until the reign of the last Sasanian ruler Yazdegerd III (r. 632–651 AD).[170] Indigenous sources on Parthian history remain scarce, with fewer of them available than for any other period of Iranian history.[171] Most contemporary written records on Parthia contain Greek as well as Parthian and Aramaic inscriptions.[172] The Parthian language was written in a distinct script derived from the Imperial Aramaic chancellery script of the Achaemenids, and later developed into the Pahlavi writing system.[173]
