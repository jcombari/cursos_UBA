A signature feature of Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side.[259] Use of the barrel vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs.[248] Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale.[259] The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD.[248] Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style.[260] The largest Parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15 m (50 ft).[261]
