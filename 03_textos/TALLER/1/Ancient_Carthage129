Dexter Hoyos argues that it is impossible to determine a "definitive answer" to the question of child sacrifice.[273] He notes that infant and child mortality were high in ancient times—with perhaps a third of Roman infants dying of natural causes in the first three centuries AD—which not only would explain the frequency of child burials, but would make the regular, large-scale sacrificing of children an existential threat to "communal survival".[274] Hoyos also notes contradictions between the various historical descriptions of the practice, many of which have not been backed by modern archaeology.[274]
