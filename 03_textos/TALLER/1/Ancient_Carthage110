In addition to its extensive trade network, Carthage had a diversified and advanced manufacturing sector. It produced finely embroidered silks,[204] dyed textiles of cotton, linen,[205] and wool, artistic and functional pottery, faience, incense, and perfumes.[206] Its artisans worked expertly with ivory,[207] glassware, and wood,[208] as well as with alabaster, bronze, brass, lead, gold, silver, and precious stones to create a wide array of goods, including mirrors, furniture[209] and cabinetry, beds, bedding, and pillows,[210] jewelry, arms, implements, and household items.[211] It traded in salted Atlantic fish and fish sauce (garum),[212]
and brokered the manufactured, agricultural, and natural products[213] of almost every Mediterranean people.[214] Bronze engraving and stone-carving are described as having reached their zenith in the fourth and third centuries.[215]
