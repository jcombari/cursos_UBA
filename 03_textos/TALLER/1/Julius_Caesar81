During his lifetime, Caesar was regarded as one of the best orators and prose authors in Latin â€”even Cicero spoke highly of Caesar's rhetoric and style.[151] Only Caesar's war commentaries have survived. A few sentences from other works are quoted by other authors. Among his lost works are his funeral oration for his paternal aunt Julia and his Anticato, a document written to defame Cato in response to Cicero's published praise. Poems by Julius Caesar are also mentioned in ancient sources.[152]
