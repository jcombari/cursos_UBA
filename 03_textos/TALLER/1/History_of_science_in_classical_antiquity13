Plato is known more for his contributions to the philosophical basis of scientific method than to particular scientific concepts.  He maintained that all things in the material world are imperfect reflections of eternal unchanging ideas, just as all mathematical diagrams are reflections of eternal unchanging mathematical truths.  Since Plato believed that material things had an inferior kind of reality, he considered that we don't achieve demonstrative knowledge – that kind of knowledge we call science — by looking at the imperfect material world.  Truth is to be found through rational demonstrations, analogous to the demonstrations of geometry.[14]  Applying this concept, Plato recommended that astronomy be studied in terms of geometrical models[15] and proposed that the elements were particles constructed on a geometrical basis.[16]
