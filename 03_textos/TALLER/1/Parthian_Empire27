Surena, with an army entirely on horseback, rode to meet Crassus.[83] Surena's 1,000 cataphracts (armed with lances) and 9,000 horse archers were outnumbered roughly four to one by Crassus' army, comprising seven Roman legions and auxiliaries including mounted Gauls and light infantry.[84] Using a baggage train of about 1,000 camels, the Parthian army provided the horse archers with a constant supply of arrows.[84] The horse archers employed the "Parthian shot" tactic: feigning retreat to draw enemy out, then turning and shooting at them when exposed. This tactic, executed with heavy composite bows on the flat plain, devastated Crassus' infantry.[85]
