The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare, exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the Predynastic Period, they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs.[101] An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.[102] Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt.[103][104]
