In 113 AD, the Roman Emperor Trajan made eastern conquests and the defeat of Parthia a strategic priority,[3] and successfully overran the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, installing Parthamaspates of Parthia as a client ruler.  Hadrian, Trajan's successor, reversed his predecessor's policy, intending to re-establish the Euphrates as the limit of Roman control.  However, in the 2nd century, war over Armenia broke out again in 161, when Vologases IV defeated the Romans there.  A Roman counter-attack under Statius Priscus defeated the Parthians in Armenia and installed a favored candidate on the Armenian throne, and an invasion of Mesopotamia culminated in the sack of Ctesiphon in 165.
