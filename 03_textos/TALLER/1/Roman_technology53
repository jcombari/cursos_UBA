Originally an incendiary weapon adopted from the Greeks in 7th century AD, the Greek fire "is one of the very few contrivances whose gruesome effectiveness was noted by"[32] many sources. Roman innovators made this already lethal weapon even more deadly. Its nature is often described as a "precursor to napalm".[32] Military strategists often put the weapon to good use during naval battles, and the ingredients to its construction "remained a closely guarded military secret".[32] Despite this, the devastation caused by Greek fire in combat is indisputable.
