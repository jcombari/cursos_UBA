Beyond the confines of the land, a schematic for a ship propelled by animals has been discovered. The work known as Anonymus De Rebus Bellicus describes a ship powered by oxen. Wherein oxen are attached to a rotary, moving in a circle on a deck floor, spinning two paddle wheels, one on either side of the ship. The likelihood that such a ship was ever built is low, due to the impracticality of controlling animals on a watercraft.[3]
