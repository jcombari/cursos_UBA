Examples of clothing in Parthian inspired sculptures have been found in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (qamis), combined with trousers and made with fine, ornamented materials.[263] The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court.[260] The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins.[264] The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in Palmyra, Syria, along with the use of Parthian frontality in art.[265]
