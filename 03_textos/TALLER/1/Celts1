The Celts (/kɛlts, sɛlts/, see pronunciation of Celt for different usages) are[1] a collection of Indo-European peoples[2] in parts of Europe and Anatolia identified by their use of the Celtic languages and other cultural similarities.[3][4][5][6] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and the exact relationship between ethnic, linguistic and cultural factors in the Celtic world remains uncertain and controversial.[7] The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is disputed; in particular, the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts have  become a subject of controversy.[6][7][8][9] According to one theory, the common root of the Celtic languages, the Proto-Celtic language, arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe, which flourished from around 1200 BC.[10]
