The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to "the one true God".[273] In Egypt, Alexander was portrayed as the son of Nectanebo II, the last pharaoh before the Persian conquest.[275] His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypt's salvation, "proving" Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian.[273]
