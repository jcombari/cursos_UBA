Leaving Egypt in 331Â BCE, Alexander marched eastward into Achaemenid Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia (now northern Iraq) and defeated Darius again at the Battle of Gaugamela.[84] Darius once more fled the field, and Alexander chased him as far as Arbela. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two.[85] Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamadan) while Alexander captured Babylon.[86]
