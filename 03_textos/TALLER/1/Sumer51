From the earliest records, the Sumerians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex[59] and their sexual mores were determined not by whether a sexual act was deemed immoral, but rather by whether or not it made a person ritually unclean.[59] The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women,[59] and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and with their partners.[59] The Sumerians did not regard anal sex as taboo either.[59] Entu priestesses were forbidden from producing offspring[60][56] and frequently engaged in anal sex as a method of birth control.[60][59][56]
