Carthage's political system changed dramatically after 483 BC, following the total rout of its forces at the battle of Himera during the First Sicilian War.[122] In response to the upheaval caused by this loss, the ruling Magonid clan was compelled to allow representative institutions that would prevent one or a handful of individuals from exercising too much power. Carthage became an oligarchic republic, characterized by an intricate system of checks and balances, a complex bureaucracy and civil society, and a fairly high degree of public accountability and participation. The most detailed information about the Carthaginian government after this point comes from the Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his fourth century BC treatise, Politics, in which Carthage is the only non-Greek example to be discussed.
