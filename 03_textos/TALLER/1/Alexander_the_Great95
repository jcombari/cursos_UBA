Alexander married three times: Roxana, daughter of the Sogdian nobleman Oxyartes of Bactria,[213][214][215] out of love;[216] and the Persian princesses Stateira II and Parysatis II, the former a daughter of Darius III and latter a daughter of Artaxerxes III, for political reasons.[217][218] He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon by Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.[219][220]
