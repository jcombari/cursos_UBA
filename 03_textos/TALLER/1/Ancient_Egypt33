Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire in 30Â BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.[63] Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.[64]
