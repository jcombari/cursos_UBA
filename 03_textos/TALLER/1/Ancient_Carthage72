At the head of the Carthaginian state were two sufetes or "judges", who had judicial and executive powers.[Note 1] Though both Greek and Roman authors commonly referred to them as kings, by at least the late fifth century BC, the sufetes were nonhereditary offices elected annually from among the wealthiest and most influential families; it is unknown how they were elected or who was eligible to serve. Livy likens the sufetes to Roman consuls, claiming they ruled mostly through collegiality and handled certain routine matters of state, such as the convocation and presidency of the Adirim (supreme council), the submission of business to the popular assembly, and the adjudication of trials.[123][Note 2] Some modern historians compare the sufetes to executive presidents, in that they did not hold absolute power and exercised largely ceremonial functions.[124][125] This practice may have originated from the plutocratic oligarchies that limited the sufetes' power in earlier Phoenician cities.[126] In the sixth century BC, Tyre had adopted a similar system, characterised as a "republic headed by elective magistrates",[127] with two sufetes chosen for short terms from among the most powerful noble families.[128]
