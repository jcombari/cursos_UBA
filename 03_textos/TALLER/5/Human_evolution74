A new proposed species Australopithecus deyiremeda is claimed to have been discovered living at the same time period of Au. afarensis. There is debate if Au. deyiremeda is a new species or is Au. afarensis.[146] Australopithecus prometheus, otherwise known as Little Foot has recently been dated at 3.67Â million years old through a new dating technique, making the genus Australopithecus as old as afarensis.[147] Given the opposable big toe found on Little Foot, it seems that he was a good climber, and it is thought given the night predators of the region, he probably, like gorillas and chimpanzees, built a nesting platform at night, in the trees.
