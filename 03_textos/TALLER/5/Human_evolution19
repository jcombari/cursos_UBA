The word homo, the name of the biological genus to which humans belong, is Latin for "human".[b] It was chosen originally by Carl Linnaeus in his classification system.[c] The word "human" is from the Latin humanus, the adjectival form of homo. The Latin "homo" derives from the Indo-European root *dhghem, or "earth".[57] Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on morphological and anatomical similarities.[58]
