Neanderthal technology is thought to have been quite sophisticated. It includes the Mousterian stone tool industry[27][28] and possibly the abilities to create fire[29][30] and build cave hearths,[31][32] make the adhesive birch bark tar,[33] craft at least simple clothes similar to blankets and ponchos,[34] weave,[35] go seafaring through the Mediterranean,[36][37] make use of medicinal plants[38][39][40] as well as treat severe injuries,[41] store food,[42] and use various cooking techniques, such as roasting, boiling,[43] and smoking.[44] Neanderthals made use of a wide array of food, mainly hoofed mammals,[45] but also other megafauna,[25][46] plants,[47][48][49] small mammals, birds, and aquatic and marine resources.[50] Although they were likely apex predators, they still competed with cave bears, cave lions, cave hyaenas, and other large predators.[51] A number of examples of symbolic thought and Palaeolithic art have been inconclusively[52] attributed to Neanderthals, namely possible ornaments made from bird bones[53][54] or shells,[55] collections of unusual objects including crystals and fossils,[56] engravings,[57] music production indicated by the Divje Babe Flute,[58] and Spanish cave paintings contentiously[59] dated to before 65,000 years ago.[60][61] Some claims of religious beliefs have been made.[62] Neanderthals were likely capable of speech, possibly articulate, although the complexity of their language is not known.[63][64]
