From about 300,000 years ago, technology, social structures and behaviour appear to grow more complex, with prepared-core technique lithics, earliest instances of burial and changes to hunting-gathering patterns of subsistence. Homo sapiens first appear about 300,000 years ago, as evidenced by fossils found at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco.[9]
