Studies have shown that the uplift has taken place in two distinct stages.  The initial uplift following deglaciation was rapid (called "elastic"), and took place as the ice was being unloaded. After this "elastic" phase, uplift proceed by "slow viscous flow" so the rate decreased exponentially after that. Today, typical uplift rates are of the order of 1Â cm per year or less. In northern Europe, this is clearly shown by the GPS data obtained by the BIFROST GPS network.[27] Studies suggest that rebound will continue for about at least another 10,000 years. The total uplift from the end of deglaciation depends on the local ice load and could be several hundred meters near the center of rebound.
