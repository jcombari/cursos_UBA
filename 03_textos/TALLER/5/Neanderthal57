It is controversially proposed that some Neanderthals wore decorative clothing or jewellery—such as a leopard skin or raptor feathers—to display elevated status in the group. Hayden postulated that the small number of Neanderthal graves found was because only high-ranking members would receive an elaborate burial, as is the case for some modern hunter gatherers.[31] Trinkaus suggested that elderly Neanderthals were given special burial rites for lasting so long given the high mortality rates.[77] Alternatively, many more Neanderthals may have received burials, but the graves were infiltrated and destroyed by bears.[239] Given that 20 graves of Neanderthals aged under 4 have been found—over a third of all known graves—deceased children may have received greater care during burial than other age demographics.[225]
