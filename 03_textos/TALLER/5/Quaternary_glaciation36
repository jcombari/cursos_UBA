Based on orbital models, the cooling trend initiated about 6,000 years ago will continue for another 23,000 years.[37]
Slight changes in the Earth's orbital parameters may, however, indicate that, even without any human contribution, there will not be another glacial period for the next 50,000 years.[38]
It is possible that the current cooling trend may be interrupted by an interstadial (a warmer period) in about 60,000 years, with the next glacial maximum reached only in about 100,000 years.[39]
