Neanderthals were once thought of as scavengers, but are now considered to have been apex predators.[240][241] In 1980, it was hypothesised that two piles of mammoth skulls at La Cotte de St Brelade, Channel Islands, at the base of a gulley were evidence of mammoth drive hunting (causing them to stampede off a ledge),[242] but this is contested.[243] Living in a forested environment, Neanderthals were likely ambush hunters, getting close to and attacking their target—a prime adult—in a short burst of speed, thrusting in a spear at close quarters.[244][65] Younger or wounded animals may have been hunted using traps, projectiles, or pursuit.[244] Nonetheless, they were able to adapt to a variety of habitats.[50][243] They appear to have eaten predominantly what was abundant within their immediate surroundings,[52] with steppe-dwelling communities (generally outside of the Mediterranean) subsisting almost entirely on meat from large game, forest-dwelling communities consuming a wide array of plants and smaller animals, and waterside communities gathering aquatic resources. Contemporary humans, in contrast, seem to have used more complex food extraction strategies and generally had a more diverse diet.[245] Nonetheless, Neanderthals still would have had to have eaten a varied enough diet to prevent nutrient deficiencies and protein poisoning, especially in the winter when they presumably ate mostly lean meat. Any food with high contents of other essential nutrients not provided by lean meat would have been vital components of their diet, such as fat-rich brains,[41] carbohydrate-rich and abundant underground storage organs (including roots and tubers),[246] or, like modern Inuit, the stomach contents of herbivorous prey items.[247]
