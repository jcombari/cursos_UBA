There is some debate if Neanderthals had long-ranged weapons.[309] A wound on the neck of an African wild ass from Umm el Tlel, Syria, was likely inflicted by a heavy Levallois-point javelin,[310] and bone trauma consistent with habitual throwing has been reported in Neanderthals.[309][311] Some spear tips from Abri du Maras, France, may have been too fragile to have been used as thrusting spears, possibly suggesting their use as darts.[255]
