Like modern humans, Neanderthals probably descended from a very small population with an effective population—the number of individuals who can bear or father children—of 3,000 to 12,000 approximately. However, Neanderthals maintained this very low population, proliferating weakly harmful genes due to the reduced effectivity of natural selection.[73][162]
Various studies, using mtDNA analysis, yield varying effective populations,[161] such as about 1,000 to 5,000;[162] 5,000 to 9,000 remaining constant;[163] or 3,000 to 25,000 steadily increasing until 52,000 years ago before declining until extinction.[75] However, all agree on low population,[161] which may have been less that 1/10th of the contemporary human populations in Western Europe[164] possibly because Neanderthals had much lower fertility rates.[165] Estimates giving a total population in the higher tens of thousands[125] are contested.[162] A consistently low population may be explained in the context of the "Boserupian Trap": a population's carrying capacity is limited by the amount of food it can obtain, which in turn is limited by its technology. Innovation increases with population, but if the population is too low, innovation will not occur very rapidly and the population will remain low. This is consistent with the apparent 150,000 year stagnation in Neanderthal lithic technology.[161]
