 The temporal lobes, which contain centers for language processing, have increased disproportionately, as has the prefrontal cortex, which has been related to complex decision-making and moderating social behavior.[27] Encephalization has been tied to increased meat and starches in the diet,[33][34][35] and the development of cooking,[36] and it has been proposed that intelligence increased as a response to an increased necessity for solving social problems as human society became more complex.[37] Changes in skull morphology, such as smaller mandibles and mandible muscle attachments, allowed more room for the brain to grow.[38]
