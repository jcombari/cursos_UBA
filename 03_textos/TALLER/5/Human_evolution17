The ulnar opposition—the contact between the thumb and the tip of the little finger of the same hand—is unique to the genus Homo,[53] including Neanderthals, the Sima de los Huesos hominins and anatomically modern humans.[54][55] In other primates, the thumb is short and unable to touch the little finger.[54] The ulnar opposition facilitates the precision grip and power grip of the human hand, underlying all the skilled manipulations.
