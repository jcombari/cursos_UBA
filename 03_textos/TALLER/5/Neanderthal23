Numerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250,000 years ago cites "H. helmei" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the Levallois technique of making stone tools. The date of about 400,000 years ago uses H. heidelbergensis as the LCA. 600,000 years ago says that "H. rhodesiensis" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/H. heidelbergensis lineage.[137] 800,000 years ago has H. antecessor as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.[137][23] However, a 2020 analysis of H. antecessor enamel proteomes suggests that H. antecessor is related but not a direct ancestor.[138] DNA studies have yielded various results on Neanderthal/human divergence time, such as 538–315,[21] 553–321,[139] 565–503,[140] 654–475,[137] 690–550,[141] 765–550,[23][83] 741–317,[142] and 800–520 thousand years ago;[143] and a dental analysis concluded before 800,000 years ago.[22]
