Before their use of fire, the hominid species had large premolars, which were used to chew harder foods, such as large seeds. In addition, due to the shape of the molar cusps,  the diet is inferred to be more leaf- or fruitâ€“based. In response to consuming cooked foods, the molar teeth of H. erectus had gradually shrunk, suggesting that their diet had changed from tougher foods such as crisp root vegetables to softer cooked foods such as meat.[55][56] Cooked foods further selected for the differentiation of their teeth and eventually led to a decreased jaw volume with a variety of smaller teeth in hominids. Today, a smaller jaw volume and teeth size of humans is seen in comparison to other primates.[57]
