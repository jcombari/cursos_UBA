Most of the evidence of controlled use of fire during the Lower Paleolithic is uncertain and has limited scholarly support.[14] Some of the evidence is inconclusive because  other plausible explanations exist, such as natural processes, for the findings.[15] Recent findings support that the earliest known controlled use of fire took place in Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa, 1.0 Mya.[14] [16]
