Some Neanderthals in Gibraltar were dated to much later than this—such as Zafarraya (30,000 years ago)[388] and Gorham's Cave (28,000 years ago)[389]—which may be inaccurate as they were based on ambiguous artefacts instead of direct dating.[12] A claim of Neanderthals surviving in a polar refuge in the Ural Mountains[154] is loosely supported by Mousterian stone tools dating to 34–31 thousand years ago from the northern Siberian Byzovaya site at a time when modern humans may not yet have colonised the northern reaches of Europe;[156] however, modern human remains are known from the nearby Mamontovaya Kurya site dating to 40,000 years ago.[390] Indirect dating of Neanderthals remains from Mezmaiskaya Cave reported a date of about 30,000 years ago, but direct dating instead yielded 39.7±1.1 thousand years ago, more in line with trends exhibited in the rest of Europe.[11]
