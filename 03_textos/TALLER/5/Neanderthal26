The southernmost find was recorded at Shuqba Cave, Levant;[147] reports of Neanderthals from the North African Jebel Irhoud[148] and Haua Fteah[149] have been reidentified as H. sapiens. Their easternmost presence is recorded at Denisova Cave, Siberia 85°E; the southeast Chinese Maba Man, a skull, shares several physical attributes with Neanderthals, although these may be the result of convergent evolution rather than Neanderthals extending their range to the Pacific Ocean.[150] The northernmost bound is generally accepted to have been 55°N, with unambiguous sites known between 50–53°N, although this is difficult to assess because glacial advances destroy most human remains, and palaeoanthropologist Trine Kellberg Nielsen has argued that a lack of evidence of Southern Scandinavian occupation is (at least during the Eemian interglacial) due to the former explanation and a lack of research in the area.[151][152] Middle Palaeolithic artefacts have been found up to 60°N on the Russian plains,[153][154][155] but these are more likely attributed to modern humans.[156] A 2017 study claimed the presence of Homo at the 130,000 year old Californian Cerutti Mastodon site in North America,[157] but this is largely considered implausible.[158][159][160]
