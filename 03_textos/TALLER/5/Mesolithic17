A 2012 publication in the Science journal, announced that the earliest pottery yet known anywhere in the world was found in Xianrendong cave in China, dating by radiocarbon to between 20,000 and 19,000 years before present, at the end of the Last Glacial Period.[20][21] The carbon 14 datation was established by carefully dating surrounding sediments.[21][22] Many of the pottery fragments had scorch marks, suggesting that the pottery was used for cooking.[22] These early pottery containers were made well before the invention of agriculture (dated to 10,000 to 8,000 BC), by mobile foragers who hunted and gathered their food during the Late Glacial Maximum.[22]
