Precisely when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine, because the more primitive these tools are (for example, sharp-edged stones) the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human artifacts.[218] There is some evidence that the australopithecines (4 Ma) may have used broken bones as tools, but this is debated.[221]
