A hunter-gatherer is a nomadic[1] human living in a society in which most or all food is obtained by foraging (collecting wild plants and pursuing wild animals). Hunter-gatherer societies stand in contrast to  agricultural societies, which rely mainly on domesticated species, although the boundaries between the two are not distinct.
