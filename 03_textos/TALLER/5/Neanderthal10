By the middle of the century, based on the exposure of Piltdown Man as a hoax as well as reexamination of La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 (who had osteoarthritis which caused slouching in life) and new discoveries, the scientific community began to rework its understanding of Neanderthals. When ideas of Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture came to be discussed, consequently, a more humanlike view of them emerged. In 1939, American anthropologist Carleton Coon reconstructed a Neanderthal in a modern business suit and hat to emphasize that they would be, more or less, indistinguishable from modern humans had they survived into the present. William Golding's 1955 novel The Inheritors depicts Neanderthals as much more emotional and civilised.[26][25][109] However, Boule's image continued to influence works until the 1960s. In modern day, Neanderthal reconstructions are often very humanlike.[104][109]
