Molecular genetics study suggests that surviving Amerindian populations derived from a theoretical single founding population, possibly from  only 50 to 70 genetic contributors[7]  Preliminary research, restricted to only 9 genomic regions (or loci) have shown a genetic link between  original Americas and Asia populations. The study does not address the question of separate migrations for these groups, and excludes other DNA data-sets.[8]
