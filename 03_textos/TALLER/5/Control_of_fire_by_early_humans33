More recent evidence dating to roughly 164,000 years ago found that early humans living in South Africa in the Middle Stone Age used fire as an engineering tool to alter the mechanical properties of the materials they used to make tools and improve their lives. Researchers found evidence that suggests early humans applied a method of heat treatment to a fine-grained, local rock called silcrete.[37]  Once treated, the heated rocks were modified and tempered into crescent-shaped blades or arrowheads.  The evidence suggests that early humans probably used the modified tools for hunting or cutting meat from killed animals.  Researchers postulate that this may have been the first time that a bow and arrows were used for hunting, an advancement that had a significant impact on how early humans may have lived, hunted, and existed as community groups.[37][38]
