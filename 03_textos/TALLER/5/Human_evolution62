The evolutionary history of the primates can be traced back 65Â million years.[129][130][131][132][133] One of the oldest known primate-like mammal species, the Plesiadapis, came from North America;[134][135][136][137][138][139] another, Archicebus, came from China.[140] Other similar basal primates were widespread in Eurasia and Africa during the tropical conditions of the Paleocene and Eocene.
