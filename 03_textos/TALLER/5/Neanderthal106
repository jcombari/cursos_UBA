Due to the absence of Neanderthal-derived mtDNA (which is passed on from mother to child) in modern populations,[124][369][141] it has been suggested that the progeny of Neanderthal females who mated with modern human males were either rare, absent, or sterileâ€”that is to say, admixture stems from the progeny of Neanderthal males with modern human females.[370][369][122][79][89] Due to the lack of Neanderthal-derived Y-chromosomes in modern humans (which is passed on from father to son), it has also been suggested that the hybrids that contributed ancestry to modern populations were predominantly females, or the Neanderthal Y-chromosome was not compatible with H. sapiens and became extinct.[371][89]
