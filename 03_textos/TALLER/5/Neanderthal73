From Lower and Middle Palaeolithic European and Middle Eastern sites, 63 stone objects with purported engravings have been reported from 27 different sites, of which 20 are on flint cortexes from 11 sites, 7 are on slabs from 7 sites, and 36 are on pebbles from 13 sites. However, it is debated whether or not these were made with symbolic intent.[57] In 2012, deep scratches on the floor of Gorham's Cave, Gibraltar, were discovered, dated to older than 39,000 years ago, which the discoverers have interpreted as Neanderthal abstract art.[287][288] The scratches could have also been produced by a bear.[239]
