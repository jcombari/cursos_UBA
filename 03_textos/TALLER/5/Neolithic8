In the Middle East, cultures identified as Neolithic began appearing in the 10th millennium BC.[7] Early development occurred in the Levant (e.g. Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. Neolithic cultures are also attested in southeastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia by around 8000Â BC.[citation needed]
