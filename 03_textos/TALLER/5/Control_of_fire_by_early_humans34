Fire was also used in the creation of art. Scientists have discovered several small, 1- to 10-inch statues in Europe referred to as the Venus figurines. These statues date back to the Paleolithic period. Several of these figures were created from stone and ivory, while some were created with clay and then fired. These are some of the earliest examples of ceramics.[39]  Fire was also commonly used to create pottery. Although the advent of pottery was first thought to have begun with the use of agriculture around 10,000 years ago, scientists in China discovered pottery fragments in the Xianrendong Cave that were about 20,000 years old.[40] During the Neolithic Age, which began about 10,000 years ago, though, the creation and use of pottery became far more widespread. These items were often carved and painted with simple linear designs and geometric shapes.[41]
