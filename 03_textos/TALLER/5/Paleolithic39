Early examples of artistic expression, such as the Venus of Tan-Tan and the patterns found on elephant bones from Bilzingsleben in Thuringia, may have been produced by Acheulean tool users such as Homo erectus prior to the start of the Middle Paleolithic period. However, the earliest undisputed evidence of art during the Paleolithic comes from Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age sites such as Blombos Cave–South Africa–in the form of bracelets,[69] beads,[70] rock art,[53] and ochre used as body paint and perhaps in ritual.[39][53] Undisputed evidence of art only becomes common in the Upper Paleolithic.[71]
