The immediate survival advantage of encephalization is difficult to discern, as the major brain changes from Homo erectus to Homo heidelbergensis were not accompanied by major changes in technology. It has been suggested that the changes were mainly social and behavioural, including increased empathic abilities,[43][44] increases in size of social groups,[45][46][47] and increased behavioural plasticity.[48] Encephalization may be due to a dependency on calorie-dense, difficult-to-acquire food.[49]
