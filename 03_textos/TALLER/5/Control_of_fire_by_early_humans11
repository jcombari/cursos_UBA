In Chesowanja, archaeologists found red clay clasts dated to 1.4 Mya. These clasts must have been heated to 400 °C (750 °F) to harden. However, tree stumps burned in bush fires in East Africa produce clasts, which when broken by erosion, are like those described at Chesownja. Controlled use of fire at Chesowanja is unproven.[15]
