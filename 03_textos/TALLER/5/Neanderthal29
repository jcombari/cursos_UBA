In a sample of 206 Neanderthals, based on the abundance of young and mature adults in comparison to other age demographics, about 80% of them above the age of 20 died before reaching 40. This high mortality rate was probably due to their high-stress environment.[77] However, it has also been estimated that the age pyramids for Neanderthals and contemporary modern humans were the same.[161] Infant mortality was estimated to have been very high for Neanderthals, about 43% in northern Eurasia.[166]
