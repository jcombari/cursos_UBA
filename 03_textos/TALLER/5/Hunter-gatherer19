A 1986 study found most hunter-gatherers have a symbolically structured sexual division of labour.[38] However, it is true that in a small minority of cases, women hunt the same kind of quarry as men, sometimes doing so alongside men. Among the Ju'/hoansi people of Namibia, women help men track down quarry.[39] Women in the Australian Martu also primarily hunt small animals like lizards to feed their children and maintain relations with other women.[40]
