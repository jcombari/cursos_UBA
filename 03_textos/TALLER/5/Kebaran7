The engravings found in Ein Qashish South involve symbolic conceptualization.[3] They suggest that the figurative and non-figurative images comprise a coherent assemblage of symbols that might have been applied in order to store, share and transmit information related to the social activities and the subsistence of mobile bands.[3] They also suggest a level of social complexity in pre-Natufian foragers in the Levant.[3] The apparent similarity in graphics throughout the Late Pleistocene world and the mode of their application support the possibility that symbolic behavior has a common and much earlier origin.[3]
