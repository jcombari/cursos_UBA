Besides the brain, other organs in the human body also demand a high level of metabolism.[49] At the same time, the body-mass portion of different organs was changing throughout the process of evolution as a means for brain expansion. Genus Homo was able to break through the limit by cooking food to lower their feeding times and be able to absorb more nutrients to accommodate the increasing need for energy.[49] In addition, scientists argue that the Homo species was also able to obtain nutrients like docosahexaenoic acid from algae that were especially beneficial and critical for brain evolution, and as mentioned in the previous sections, the detoxification of the cooking process enabled early humans to access these resources.[50]
