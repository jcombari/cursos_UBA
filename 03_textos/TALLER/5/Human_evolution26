In 2013, fossil skeletons of Homo naledi, an extinct species of hominin assigned (provisionally) to the genus Homo, were found in the Rising Star Cave system, a site in South Africa's Cradle of Humankind region in Gauteng province near Johannesburg.[68][69] As of SeptemberÂ 2015[update], fossils of at least fifteen individuals, amounting to 1,550 specimens, have been excavated from the cave.[69] The species is characterized by a body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations, a smaller endocranial volume similar to Australopithecus, and a cranial morphology (skull shape) similar to early Homo species. The skeletal anatomy combines primitive features known from australopithecines with features known from early hominins. The individuals show signs of having been deliberately disposed of within the cave near the time of death. The fossils were dated close to 250,000 years ago,[70] and thus are not a direct ancestor but a contemporary with the first appearance of larger-brained anatomically modern humans.[71]
