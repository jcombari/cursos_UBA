The first Neanderthal genome sequence was published in 2010, and strongly indicated interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern humans.[78][350][351][352] The genomes of all non-sub-Saharan populations contain Neanderthal DNA.[78][353][80][354] Various estimates exist for the proportion: 1–4% in modern Eurasians,[78] 3.4–7.9%,[355] One study, using the IBDmix method, concluded that the all genomes of modern people from the 1000 genomes project, including Africans, had Neanderthal genes (with the amount of Neanderthal DNA in Asians being 55 megabases (Mb) or 1.8%, in Europeans - 51 MB or about 1.7%,[356] and in Africans about 17 MB or 0.3% of their genome,[357] while previous findings have found that Africans have significantly less megabase - in the previous lakh from 0.026 Mb for the people  ishan to 0.5 Mb for the peoples Luhya). Africans share 7.2% of their Neanderthal admixture exclusively with Europeans, significantly higher than the 2% that Africans share exclusively with East Asians. 1.8–2.4% in modern Europeans and 2.3–2.6% in modern East Asians.[358] However, some scientists, such as geneticist David Reich, dispute the study's conclusions suggesting widespread Neanderthal admixture in sub-Saharan Africans.[359] Pre-agricultural Europeans appear to have had similar percentages to modern East Asians, and the numbers may have decreased in the former due to dilution with a group of people which had split off before Neanderthal introgression.[89] Such low percentages indicate infrequent interbreeding.[360] However, it is possible interbreeding was more common with a different population of modern humans which did not contribute to the present day gene pool.[89] Of the inherited Neanderthal genome, 25% in modern Europeans and 32% in modern East Asians may be related to viral immunity.[361] In all, approximately 20% of the Neanderthal genome appears to have survived in the modern human gene pool.[85]
