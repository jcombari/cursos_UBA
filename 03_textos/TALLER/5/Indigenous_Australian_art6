The Maliwawa Figures were documented in a study led by Paul Taçon and published in Australian Archaeology in September 2020.[11] The art includes 572 images across 87 sites in northwest Arnhem Land, from Awunbarna (Mount Borradaile[12]) area across to the Wellington Range. They are estimated to have been drawn between 6,000 and 9,400 years ago.[13] The find is described as very rare, not only in style, but in their depiction of bilbies (not known historically in Arnhem Land)[14] and the first known depiction of a dugong.[15] The art, all paintings in red to mulberry colour apart from one drawing, and in a naturalistic style, had not been described in the literature before this study. They are large, and depict relationships between people and animals, a rare theme in rock art. Bilbies, thylacines and dugong have been extinct in Arnhem land for millennia. The art was first seen by the 2008-2009 researchers, but were only studied in field research lasting from 2016 to 2018. The figures were named by Ronald Lamilami, a senior Traditional Owner.[12][16] According to Tacon, "The Maliwawa back-to-back figures are the oldest known for western Arnhem Land and it appears this painting convention began with the Maliwawa style. It continues to the present with bark paintings and paintings on paper".[17] Taçon draws comparisons between the Maliwawa Figures and George Chaloupka's Dynamic Figures style, where the subject matter consists of about 89 percent humans, compared with 42% of the Maliwawa Figures.[18] There is, however, much complexity and debate regarding the classification of rock art style in Arnhem Land.[11][19]
