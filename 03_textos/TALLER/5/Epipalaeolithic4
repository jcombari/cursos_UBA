Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers, generally nomadic, made relatively advanced tools from small flint or obsidian blades, known as microliths, that were hafted in wooden implements.  There are settlements with "flimsy structures", probably not permanently occupied except at some rich sites, but used and returned to seasonally.[5]
