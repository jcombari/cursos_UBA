For meat, they appear to have fed predominantly on hoofed mammals, namely red deer and reindeer as these two were the most abundant game,[45] but also on other Pleistocene megafauna such as ibex, wild boar, aurochs, mammoth, straight-tusked elephant, woolly rhinoceros, and so on.[25][46][248] There is evidence of directed cave and brown bear hunting both in and out of hibernation, as well as butchering.[249] Analysis of Neanderthal bone collagen from Vindija Cave, Croatia, shows nearly all of their protein needs derived from animal meat.[46] Some caves show evidence of regular rabbit and tortoise consumption. At Gibraltar sites, there are remains of 143 different bird species, many ground-dwelling such as the common quail, corn crake, woodlark, and crested lark.[50] Neanderthals also exploited marine resources on the Iberian, Italian, and Peloponnesian Peninsulas, where they waded or dived for shellfish,[50][250][251] as early as 150,000 years ago at Cueva Bajondillo, Spain, similar to the fishing record of modern humans.[252] At Vanguard Cave, Gibraltar, the inhabitants consumed Mediterranean monk seal, short-beaked common dolphin, common bottlenose dolphin, Atlantic bluefin tuna, sea bream, and purple sea urchin;[50][253] and at Gruta da Figueira Brava, Portugal, there is evidence of large-scale harvest of shellfish, crabs, and fish.[254] Evidence of freshwater fishing was found in Grotte di Castelcivita, Italy, for trout, chub, and eel;[251] Abri du Maras, France, for chub and European perch; Payr√©, France;[255] and Kudaro Cave, Russia, for Black Sea salmon.[256]
