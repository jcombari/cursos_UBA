One of the world's most important crops, barley, was domesticated in the Near East around 11,000 years ago (c. 9,000 BCE).[39] Barley is a highly resilient crop, able to grow in varied and marginal environments, such as in regions of high altitude and latitude.[39] Archaeobotanical evidence shows that barley had spread throughout Eurasia by 2,000 BCE.[39] To further elucidate the routes by which barley cultivation was spread through Eurasia, genetic analysis was used to determine genetic diversity and population structure in extant barley taxa.[39] Genetic analysis shows that cultivated barley spread through Eurasia via several different routes, which were most likely separated in both time and space.[39]
