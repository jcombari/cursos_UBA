The Moche civilization of South America independently discovered and developed bronze smelting.[90] Bronze technology was developed further by the Incas and used widely both for utilitarian objects and sculpture.[91] A later appearance of limited bronze smelting in West Mexico suggests either contact of that region with Andean cultures or separate discovery of the technology. The Calchaqu√≠ people of Northwest Argentina had bronze technology.[92]
