Body proportions are usually cited as being "hyperarctic" as adaptations to the cold, because they are similar to those of human populations which developed in cold climates[176]—the Neanderthal build is most similar to that of Inuit and Siberian Yupiks among modern humans[177]—and shorter limbs equates to higher retention of body heat.[168][176][178] Nonetheless, Neanderthals from more temperate climates—such as Iberia—still retain the "hyperarctic" physique.[179] In 2019, English anthropologist John Stewart and colleagues suggested Neanderthals instead were adapted for sprinting because of evidence of Neanderthals preferring more warmer wooded areas over the colder mammoth steppe, and DNA analysis indicating a higher proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibres in Neanderthals than modern humans. He explained their body proportions and greater muscle mass as adaptations to sprinting as opposed to the endurance-oriented modern human physique,[65] as persistence hunting may only be effective in hot climates where the hunter can run prey to the point of heat exhaustion (hyperthermia). They had longer heel bones,[180] reducing their ability for endurance running, and their shorter limbs would have reduced moment arm at the limbs, allowing for greater rotational force at the wrists and ankles without extra exertion of the rotating muscles at the elbows and knees by increasing the speed at which the muscles contracted, causing faster acceleration.[65] In 1981, American palaeoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus made note of this alternate explanation, but considered it less likely.[168][181]
