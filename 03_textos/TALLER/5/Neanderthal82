At Abri du Maras, France, twisted fibres and a 3-ply inner-bark-fibre cord fragment associated with Neanderthals show that they produced string and cordage, but it is unclear how widespread this technology was because the materials used to make them (such as animal hair, hide, sinew, or plant fibres) are biodegradable and preserve very poorly. This technology could indicate at least a basic knowledge of weaving and knotting, which would have made possible the production of nets, containers, packaging, baskets, carrying devices, ties, straps, harnesses, clothes, shoes, beds, bedding, mats, flooring, roofing, walls, and snares, and would have been important in hafting, fishing, and seafaring. Dating to 52–41 thousand years ago, the cord fragment is the oldest direct evidence of fibre technology, although 115,000 year old perforated shell beads from Cueva Antón possibly strung together to make a necklace are the oldest indirect evidence.[35][255] British archaeologist Rebecca Wragg Sykes expresses cautious support for the genuineness of the find, but points out that the string would have been so weak that it would have had limited functions. One possibility is as thread for attaching or stringing small objects.[312] The archaeological record shows that Neanderthals commonly used animal hide and birch bark, may have used them to make cooking containers, although this is based largely on circumstantial evidence, becauce neither fossilise well.[260] It is possible the Neanderthals at Kebara Cave, Israel, used the shells of the spur-thighed tortoise as containers.[313]
