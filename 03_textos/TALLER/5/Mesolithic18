While Paleolithic and Neolithic have been found useful terms and concepts in the archaeology of China, and can be mostly regarded as happily naturalized, Mesolithic was introduced later, mostly after 1945, and does not appear to be a necessary or useful term in the context of China.  Chinese sites that have been regarded as Mesolithic are better considered as "Early Neolithic".[26]
