The  American Journal of Human Genetics released an article in 2007  stating "Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Indigenous American haplogroups, including Haplogroup X (mtDNA), were part of a single founding population."[9] Amerindian groups in the Bering Strait region exhibit perhaps the strongest DNA or mitochondrial DNA relations to Siberian peoples. The genetic diversity of Amerindian indigenous groups  increase with distance from the assumed entry point into the Americas.[10][11] Certain genetic diversity patterns from West to East  suggest at least some coastal migration events.[12]  Geneticists have variously estimated that peoples of Asia and the Americas were part of the same population from 42,000 to 21,000 years ago.[13]
