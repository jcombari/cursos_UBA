The Middle Stone Age was a period of African prehistory between Early Stone Age and Late Stone Age. It began around 300,000 years ago and ended around 50,000 years ago.[64] It is considered as an equivalent of European Middle Paleolithic.[65] It is associated with anatomically modern or almost modern Homo sapiens. Early physical evidence comes from Omo[66] and Herto,[67] both in Ethiopia and dated respectively at c. 195 ka and at c. 160 ka.
