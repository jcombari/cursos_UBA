Around 6500 BCE, agriculture emerged in Balochistan, on the margins of the Indus alluvium.[5][p][34][q] In the following millennia, settled life made inroads into the Indus plains, setting the stage for the growth of rural and urban human settlements.[35][r] The more organized sedentary life in turn led to a net increase in the birth rate.[5][s] The large urban centres of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa very likely grew to containing between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, and during the civilization's florescence, the population of the subcontinent grew to between 4–6 million people.[5][t] During this period the death rate increased as well, for close living conditions of humans and domesticated animals led to an increase in contagious diseases.[34][u]  According to one estimate, the population of the Indus civilization at its peak may have been between one and five million.[36][v]
