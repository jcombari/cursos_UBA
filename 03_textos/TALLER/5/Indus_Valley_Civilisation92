The Ghaggar-Hakra system was rain-fed,[216][al][217][am] and water-supply depended on the monsoons. The Indus Valley climate grew significantly cooler and drier from about 1800Â BCE, linked to a general weakening of the monsoon at that time.[113] The Indian monsoon declined and aridity increased, with the Ghaggar-Hakra retracting its reach towards the foothills of the Himalaya,[113][218][219] leading to erratic and less extensive floods that made inundation agriculture less sustainable.
