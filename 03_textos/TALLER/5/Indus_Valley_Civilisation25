Mehrgarh is a Neolithic (7000 BCE to c. 2500 BCE) site in the Balochistan province of Pakistan,[80] which gave new insights on the emergence of the Indus Valley Civilization.[68][y] Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia.[81][82]  Mehrgarh was influenced by the Near Eastern Neolithic,[83] with similarities between "domesticated wheat varieties, early phases of farming, pottery, other archaeological artefacts, some domesticated plants and herd animals."[84][z]
