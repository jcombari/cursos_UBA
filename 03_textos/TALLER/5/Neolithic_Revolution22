Current evidence suggests that Neolithic material culture was introduced to Europe via western Anatolia. All Neolithic sites in Europe contain ceramics, and contain the plants and animals domesticated in Southwest Asia: einkorn, emmer, barley, lentils, pigs, goats, sheep, and cattle. Genetic data suggest that no independent domestication of animals took place in Neolithic Europe, and that all domesticated animals were originally domesticated in Southwest Asia.[50] The only domesticate not from Southwest Asia was broomcorn millet, domesticated in East Asia.[51]The earliest evidence of cheese-making dates to 5500 BCE in Kujawy, Poland.[52]
