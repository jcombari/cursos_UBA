Anthropologist Pat Shipman suggested that the domestication of the wolf could have played a role in Neanderthals' extinction, or rather, a symbiosis with wolves long preceding domestication. She claims that modern humans, about 50â€“45 thousand years ago, evolved the whites of the eyes to allow for more effective non-verbal communications with wolves, and this gave modern humans an advantage in hunting. She also claims that Neanderthals did not have very prominent whites of the eyes, like the rest of the animal kingdom.[404]
