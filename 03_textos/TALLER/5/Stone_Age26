By voluntary agreement,[citation needed] archaeologists respect the decisions of the Pan-African Congress on Prehistory, which meets every four years to resolve archaeological business brought before it.

It adopted Goodwin and Lowe's 3-stage system at that time, the stages to be called Early, Middle and Later.
