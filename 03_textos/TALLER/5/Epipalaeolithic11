Stjerna made no mention of the Mesolithic, and it is unclear if he intended his terms to replace that.  His new terms were soon adopted by the German Hugo Obermaier, who in 1916 used them in El Hombre f√≥sil (translated into English in 1924) as part of an attack on the concept of the Mesolithic, which he insisted was a period of "transition" and an "interim" rather than "transformation":[18]
