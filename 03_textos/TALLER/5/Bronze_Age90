Copper smelting took place in West Africa prior to the appearance of iron smelting in the region. Evidence for copper smelting furnaces was found near Agadez, Niger that has been dated as early as 2200 BC.[84] However, evidence for copper production in this region before 1000 BC is debated.[89][82][84] Evidence of copper mining and smelting has been found at Akjoujt, Mauretania that suggests small scale production c.â€‰800 to 400 BC.[84]
