After reconstructing them as apelike in 1911, Boule concluded that Neanderthals were exterminated by invading modern humans.[108] This was the prevailing hypothesis on Neanderthal extinction until the middle of the century when Neanderthals were reconstructed as being more civilised in scientific thought. At this point, the killer ape hypothesis was popularised, which states that modern humans evolved on a violent and war-driven path, killing off the comparatively peaceful Neanderthals while colonising Europe.[109] In 1992, Jared Diamond in his book The Third Chimpanzee said competitive replacement often occurs in human history when a more technologically advanced culture (modern humans) meets a less advanced culture (Neanderthals).[14]
