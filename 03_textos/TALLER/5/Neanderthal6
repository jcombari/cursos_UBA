Neanderthals are named after the valley, the Neandertal, in which the first identified specimen was found. The valley was spelled Neanderthal and the species was spelled Neanderthaler in German until the spelling reform of 1901.[b] The spelling Neandertal for the species is occasionally seen in English, even in scientific publications, but the scientific name, H. neanderthalensis, is always spelled with th according to the principle of priority. The vernacular name of the species in German is always Neandertaler ("inhabitant of the Neander Valley"), whereas Neandertal always refers to the valley.[c] The valley itself was named after the late 17th century German theologian and hymn writer Joachim Neander who often visited the area.[90] Neanderthal can be pronounced using the /t/ (as in /niˈændərtɑːl/)[93] or the standard English pronunciation of th with the fricative /θ/ (as /niˈændərθɔːl/).[94][95]
