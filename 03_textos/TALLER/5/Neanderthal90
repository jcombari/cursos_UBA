Nonetheless, as opposed to the bone sewing-needles and stitching awls assumed to have been in use by contemporary modern humans, the only known Neanderthal tools that could have been used to fashion clothes are hide scrapers, which could have made items similar to blankets or ponchos, and there is no direct evidence they could produce fitted clothes.[34][319] Indirect evidence of tailoring by Neanderthals includes the ability to manufacture string, which could indicate weaving ability,[255] and a naturally-pointed horse metatarsal bone from Cueva de los Aviones, Spain, which was speculated to have been used as an awl, perforating dyed hides, based on the presence of orange pigments.[262] Whatever the case, Neanderthals would have needed to cover up most of their body, and contemporary humans would have covered 80â€“90%.[319][320]
