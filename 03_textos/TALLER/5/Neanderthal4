Compared to modern humans, Neanderthals had a more robust build and proportionally shorter limbs. These features are often explained as adaptations to conserve heat in a cold climate, but may also be adaptations for sprinting in the warmer, forested landscape that Neanderthals often inhabited.[65] Nonetheless, they had cold-specific adaptations, such as specialised body fat storage[66] and an enlarged nose to warm air[67] (although the nose could have been caused by genetic drift[68]). Average Neanderthal men stood around 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) and women 153 cm (5 ft) tall, similar to pre-industrial modern humans.[69] The braincases of Neanderthal men and women averaged about 1,600 cm3 (98 cu in) and 1,300 cm3 (79 cu in) respectively,[70][71][72] which is within the range of the values for modern humans.
