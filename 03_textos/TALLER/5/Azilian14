Villalba-Mouco et al. 2019 examined the remains of two males of the Azilian culture buried at the Late Upper Paleolithic site of Balma de Guilany√†, Catatonia, Spain c. 11,380-9,990 BC. They were found to be carrying the paternal haplogroups I1 and C1a1a, and the maternal haplogroups U5b2a and U2'3'4'7'8'9. They had a significant genetic affinity to earlier individuals of the Magdalenian culture.[13]
