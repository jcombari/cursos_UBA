The Epipalaeolithic has been defined as the "final Upper Palaeolithic industries occurring at the end of the final glaciation which appear to merge technologically into the Mesolithic".[1]   The period is generally dated from c. 20,000 BP to 10,000 BP in the Levant,[2] but later in Europe.  If used as a synonym or equivalent for Mesolithic in Europe, it might end at about c. 5,000 BP or even later.
