On 14 October 1066, William the Conqueror gained a decisive victory at the Battle of Hastings, which led to the conquest of England three years later;[36] this can be seen on the Bayeux tapestry.  The invading Normans and their descendants largely replaced the Anglo-Saxons as the ruling class of England.  The nobility of England were part of a single Norman culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel.  Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent.  They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of Kingâ€”an important status symbol).
