In 747, Easter fell on 2 April, a coincidence that likely would have been remarked upon by chroniclers but was not.[22] If Easter was being used as the beginning of the calendar year, then 2 April 747 could have been, by modern reckoning, April 748 (not on Easter). The date favoured by the preponderance of evidence[6] is 2 April 742, based on Charlemagne's age at the time of his death.[21] This date supports the concept that Charlemagne was technically an illegitimate child, although that is not mentioned by Einhard in either since he was born out of wedlock; Pepin and Bertrada were bound by a private contract or Friedelehe[6] at the time of his birth, but did not marry until 744.[23]
