By the 6th century, the western Germanic tribe of the Franks had been Christianised, due in considerable measure to the Catholic conversion of Clovis I.[12] Francia, ruled by the Merovingians, was the most powerful of the kingdoms that succeeded the Western Roman Empire.[13] Following the Battle of Tertry, the Merovingians declined into powerlessness, for which they have been dubbed the rois fain√©ants ("do-nothing kings").[14] Almost all government powers were exercised by their chief officer, the mayor of the palace.[e]
