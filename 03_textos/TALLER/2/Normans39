In April 1191, Richard the Lion-hearted left Messina with a large fleet in order to reach Acre.[38] But a storm dispersed the fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fianc√©e Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, together with the wrecks of several other ships, including the treasure ship. Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's despot Isaac Komnenos.[39] On 1 May 1191, Richard's fleet arrived in the port of Limassol on Cyprus.[39] He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure.[39] Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Limassol.[40]
