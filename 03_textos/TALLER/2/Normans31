The Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at Bannow Bay in 1169. Initially, the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity.  Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became "more Irish than the Irish themselves".  The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle.  The cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook.  Norman surnames still exist today.  Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford, where the first Norman settlements were established.  Other Norman names, such as Furlong, predominate[clarification needed] there.  Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from the French Norman name Morel.  Names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) usually indicate Norman ancestry.  Hiberno-Norman surnames with the prefix - 'fitz' include Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice.  Families bearing such surnames as Barry (de Barra) and De BÃºrca (Burke) are also of Norman extraction.
