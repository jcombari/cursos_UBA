They raided and pillaged, traded, acted as mercenaries and settled colonies over a wide area.[69] Early Vikings probably returned home after their raids. Later in their history, they began to settle in other lands.[70] Vikings under Leif Erikson, heir to Erik the Red, reached North America and set up short-lived settlements in present-day L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada. This expansion occurred during the Medieval Warm Period.[71]
