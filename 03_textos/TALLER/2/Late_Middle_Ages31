Avignon was the seat of the papacy from 1309 to 1376.[58] With the return of the Pope to Rome in 1378, the Papal State developed into a major secular power, culminating in the morally corrupt papacy of Alexander VI.[59] Florence grew to prominence amongst the Italian city-states through financial business, and the dominant Medici family became important promoters of the Renaissance through their patronage of the arts.[60] Other city states in northern Italy also expanded their territories and consolidated their power, primarily Milan and Venice.[61] The War of the Sicilian Vespers had by the early 14th century divided southern Italy into an Aragon Kingdom of Sicily and an Anjou Kingdom of Naples.[62] In 1442, the two kingdoms were effectively united under Aragonese control.[63]
