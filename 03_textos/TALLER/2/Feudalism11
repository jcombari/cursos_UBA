The most widely held theory was proposed by Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern in 1870,[19][20] being supported by, amongst others, William Stubbs[18][21] and Marc Bloch.[18][22][23] Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term *fehu-ôd, in which *fehu means "cattle" and -ôd means "goods", implying "a moveable object of value".[22][23] Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with moveable objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as feos, a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word feos meaning movable property changed little by little to feus meaning the exact opposite: landed property.[22][23] It has also been suggested that word comes from the Gothic faihu, meaning "property", specifically,"cattle".[24]
