The Origo Gentis Langobardorum tells the story of a small tribe called the Winnili[2] dwelling in southern Scandinavia[3] (Scadanan) (the Codex Gothanus writes that the Winnili first dwelt near a river called Vindilicus on the extreme boundary of Gaul).[17] The Winnili were split into three groups and one part left their native land to seek foreign fields. The reason for the exodus was probably overpopulation.[18] The departing people were led by the brothers Ybor and Aio and their mother Gambara[19][20] and arrived in the lands of Scoringa, perhaps the Baltic coast[21] or the Bardengau on the banks of the Elbe.[22] Scoringa was ruled by the Vandals and their chieftains, the brothers Ambri and Assi, who granted the Winnili a choice between tribute or war.
