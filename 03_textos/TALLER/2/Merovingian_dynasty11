Upon Clovis's death in 511, the Merovingian kingdom included all of Gaul except Burgundy and all of Germania magna except Saxony. To the outside, the kingdom, even when divided under different kings, maintained unity and conquered Burgundy in 534. After the fall of the Ostrogoths, the Franks also conquered Provence.[6] After this their borders with Italy (ruled by the Lombards since 568) and Visigothic Septimania remained fairly stable.[7]
