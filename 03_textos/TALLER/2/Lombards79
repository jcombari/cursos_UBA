The legend from Origo may hint that initially, before the passage from Scandinavia to the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, the Lombards worshiped the Vanir. Later, in contact with other Germanic populations, they adopted the worship of the Ã†sir: an evolution that marked the passage from the adoration of deities related to fertility and the earth to the cult of warlike gods.[90][91]
