There is no commonly accepted modern definition of feudalism, at least among scholars.[4][7]  The adjective feudal was coined in the 17th century, and the noun feudalism, often used in a political and propaganda context, was not coined until the 19th century,[4] from the French féodalité (feudality), itself an 18th-century creation.
