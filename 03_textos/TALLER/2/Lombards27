In the mid-2nd century, the Lombards supposedly appeared in the Rhineland, because according to Claudius Ptolemy, the Suebic Lombards lived "below" the Bructeri and Sugambri, and between these and the Tencteri. To their east stretching northwards to the central Elbe are the Suebi Angili.[50] But Ptolemy also mentions the "Laccobardi" to the north of the above-mentioned Suebic territories, east of the Angrivarii on the Weser, and south of the Chauci on the coast, probably indicating a Lombard expansion from the Elbe to the Rhine.[51] This double mention has been interpreted as an editorial error by Gudmund Sch√ºtte, in his analysis of Ptolemy.[52] However, the Codex Gothanus also mentions Patespruna (Paderborn) in connection with the Lombards.[53]
