The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and the Near East.[5][6] The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Catholic piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy of the Romance community.[3] The original Norse settlers adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their Old Norman dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language which is still spoken today in parts of Normandy (Cotentinais and Cauchois dialects) and the nearby Channel Islands (Jèrriais and Guernésiais). The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure.[7][8] By the end of the reign of Richard I of Normandy in 996 (byname "Richard sans Peur" meaning Richard the Fearless), the descendants of the Norse settlers of the province were, according to Cambridge Medieval History (Volume 5, Chapter XV), "not only Christians but in all essentials Frenchmen".[9]
