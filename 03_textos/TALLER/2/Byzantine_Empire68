In terms of prosperity and cultural life, the Komnenian period was one of the peaks in Byzantine history,[117] and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture.[118] There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek.[119] Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of long lasting significance.[120]
