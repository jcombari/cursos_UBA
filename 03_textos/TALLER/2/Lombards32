Moving out of Golanda, the Lombards passed through Anthaib and Banthaib until they reached Vurgundaib, believed to be the old lands of the Burgundes.[64][65] In Vurgundaib, the Lombards were stormed in camp by "Bulgars" (probably Huns)[66] and were defeated; King Agelmund was killed and Laimicho was made king. He was in his youth and desired to avenge the slaughter of Agelmund.[67] The Lombards themselves were probably made subjects of the Huns after the defeat but rose up and defeated them with great slaughter,[68] gaining great booty and confidence as they "became bolder in undertaking the toils of war."[69]
