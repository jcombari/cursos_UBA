The Normans (Norman: Normaunds; French: Normands; Latin: Nortmanni/Normanni; Old Norse: Norðmaðr) are an ethnic group that arose from contact between Norse Viking settlers of a region in France, named Normandy after them, and indigenous Franks and Gallo-Romans.[1][2] The settlements in France  followed a series of raids on the French coast mainly from Denmark — although some came from Norway and Sweden as well — and gained political legitimacy when the Viking leader Rollo agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia following the Siege of Chartres in 911 AD.[3] The intermingling of Norse settlers and native Franks and Gallo-Romans in Normandy produced an ethnic and cultural "Norman" identity in the first half of the 10th century, an identity which continued to evolve over the centuries.[4]
