The Battle of Cr√©cy was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the longbowmen and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.[27] Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King David II of Scotland responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the Battle of Neville's Cross, on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.[25][28]
