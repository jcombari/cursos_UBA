The descendants of Vikings replaced the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism (Christianity) and the Langue d'oil of the local people, descending from the Latin of the Romans. The Norman language (Norman French ) was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'o√Øl branch of Romance by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the French regional languages that survive today.[3]
