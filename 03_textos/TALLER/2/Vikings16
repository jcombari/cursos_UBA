During and after the Viking raid on Seville in 844 CE the Muslim chroniclers of al-Andalus referred to the Vikings as Magians (Arabic: al-Majus مجوس), conflating them with fire worshipping Zoroastrians from Persia.[45][46] When Ibn Fadlan was taken captive by Vikings in the Volga, he referred to them as Rus.[47][48][49]
