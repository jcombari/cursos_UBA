With his health deteriorating, the Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, where his father Edward III was elderly and also in poor health. The prince's illness was debilitating and he died on 8 June 1376.[52] Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377;[53] and was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son Richard II (Edward of Angoulême (his first son) had died sometime earlier), who was still a child of 10.[54] The treaty of Brétigny had left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France but a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and by the time Charles V died in 1380, the English held only Calais and a few other ports.[55]
