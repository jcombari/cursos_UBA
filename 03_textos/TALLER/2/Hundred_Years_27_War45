Edward invaded France, for the third and last time, hoping to capitalise on the discontent and seize the throne. The Dauphin's strategy was that of non-engagement with the English army in the field. However, Edward wanted the crown and chose the cathedral city of Reims for his coronation (Reims was the traditional coronation city).[37] However, the citizens of Reims built and reinforced the city's defences before Edward and his army arrived.[38] Edward besieged the city for five weeks, but the defences held and there was no coronation.[37] Edward moved on to Paris, but retreated after a few skirmishes in the suburbs. Next was the town of Chartres.
