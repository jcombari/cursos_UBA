The Justinian dynasty was founded by Justin I, who though illiterate, rose through the ranks of the military to become Emperor in 518.[37] He was succeeded by his nephew Justinian I in 527, who may already have exerted effective control during Justin's reign.[38] One of the most important figures of late antiquity and possibly the last Roman emperor to speak Latin as a first language,[39] Justinian's rule constitutes a distinct epoch, marked by the ambitious but only partly realised renovatio imperii, or "restoration of the Empire".[40] His wife Theodora was particularly influential.[41]
