The death of Alexander III of Scotland in 1286 threw the country into a succession crisis, and the English king, Edward I, was brought in to arbitrate. Edward claimed overlordship over Scotland, leading to the Wars of Scottish Independence.[26] The English were eventually defeated, and the Scots were able to develop a stronger state under the Stewarts.[27]
