Like elsewhere in medieval Europe, most women in Viking society were subordinate to their husbands and fathers and had little political power.[160][161] However, the written sources portray free Viking women as having independence and rights. Viking women generally appear to have had more freedom than women elsewhere,[161] as illustrated in the Icelandic Grágás and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws.[162]
