The label "Saxons" (in Romanian: Sa»ôi) also became attached to  German settlers who  settled during the 12th century in southeastern Transylvania. From Transylvania, some of these Saxons migrated to neighbouring Moldavia, as the name of the town Sas-cut shows. Sascut lies in the part of Moldavia that forms part of present-day Romania.
