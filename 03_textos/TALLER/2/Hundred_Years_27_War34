Relations with Flanders were also tied to the English wool trade, since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his chancellor sit on the woolsack in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.[21] At the time there were about 110,000 sheep in Sussex alone.[22] The great medieval English monasteries produced large surpluses of wool that were sold to mainland Europe. Successive governments were able to make large amounts of money by taxing it.[21] France's sea power led to economic disruptions for England, shrinking the wool trade to Flanders and the wine trade from Gascony.[23][24]
