Scandinavian Vikings were similar in appearance to modern Scandinavians; "their skin was fair and the hair color varied between blond, dark and reddish". Genetic studies show that people were mostly blond in what is now eastern Sweden, while red hair was mostly found in western Scandinavia.[170] Most Viking men had shoulder-length hair and beards, and slaves (thralls) were usually the only men with short hair.[171] The length varied according to personal preference and occupation. Men involved in warfare, for example, may have had slightly shorter hair and beards for practical reasons. Men in some regions bleached their hair a golden saffron color.[171] Females also had long hair, with girls often wearing it loose or braided and married women often wearing it in a bun.[171] The average height is estimated to have been 67 inches (5'5") for men and 62 inches (5'1") for women.[170]
