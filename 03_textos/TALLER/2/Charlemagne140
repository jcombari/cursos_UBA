Charlemagne was revered as a saint in the Holy Roman Empire and some other locations after the twelfth century. The Apostolic See did not recognise his invalid canonisation by Antipope Paschal III, done to gain the favour of Frederick Barbarossa in 1165. The Apostolic See annulled all of Paschal's ordinances at the Third Lateran Council in 1179.[150] He is not enumerated among the 28 saints named "Charles" in the Roman Martyrology.[151] His beatification has been acknowledged as cultus confirmed and is celebrated on 28 January.[85][152]
