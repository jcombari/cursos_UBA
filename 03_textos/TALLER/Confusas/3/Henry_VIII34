Henry married his last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543.[132] A reformer at heart, she argued with Henry over religion. Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood that had gained ground after Cromwell's fall had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it.[133] Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth.[134] In 1543, the Third Succession Act put them back in the line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.[135]
