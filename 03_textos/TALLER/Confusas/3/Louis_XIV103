Louis was a pious and devout king who saw himself as the head and protector of the Gallican Church. He made his devotions daily regardless of where he was, following the liturgical calendar regularly.[93] Under the influence of his very religious second wife, he became much stronger in the practice of his Catholic faith.[94] This included banning opera and comedy performances during Lent.[94]
