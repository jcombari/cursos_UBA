Matthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them.[104] The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars—mostly Italian—to settle in Buda.[105] Antonio Bonfini, Pietro Ranzano, Bartolomeo Fonzio, and Francesco Bandini spent many years in Matthias's court.[106][104] This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of Neoplatonism to Hungary.[107][108] Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations.[109] Galeotto Marzio described him as "king and astrologer", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias "never did anything without consulting the stars".[110] Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, Johannes Regiomontanus and Marcin Bylica, set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes.[111] Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by Christopher Columbus to Matthias.[105]
