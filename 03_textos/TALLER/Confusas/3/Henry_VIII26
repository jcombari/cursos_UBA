On 8 January 1536, news reached the king and the queen that Catherine of Aragon had died. The following day, Henry dressed all in yellow, with a white feather in his bonnet.[96] The queen was pregnant again, and she was aware of the consequences if she failed to give birth to a son.  Later that month, the King was unhorsed in a tournament and was badly injured; it seemed for a time that his life was in danger. When news of this accident reached the queen, she was sent into shock and miscarried a male child at about 15 weeks' gestation, on the day of Catherine's funeral, 29 January 1536.[97] For most observers, this personal loss was the beginning of the end of this royal marriage.[98]
