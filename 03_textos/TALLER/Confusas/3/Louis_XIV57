France also attempted to participate actively in Jesuit missions to China. To break the Portuguese dominance there, Louis sent Jesuit missionaries to the court of the Kangxi Emperor in 1685: Jean de Fontaney, Joachim Bouvet, Jean-Fran√ßois Gerbillon, Louis Le Comte, and Claude de Visdelou.[45] Louis also received a Chinese Jesuit, Michael Shen Fu-Tsung, at Versailles in 1684.[46] Furthermore, Louis' librarian and translator Arcadio Huang was Chinese.[47][48]
