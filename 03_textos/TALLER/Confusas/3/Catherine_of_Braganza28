After the tri-centennial of the establishment of Queens County in 1983, a group of Portuguese-Americans began raising money to erect a 35-foot statue of Queen Catherine on the East River waterfront in Long Island City. The sculptor of the proposed statue was Audrey Flack, and the project received support from several notable public figures, including Donald Trump. However, the project was well into development when opposition arose. Historians objected to the statue on the grounds that there was no evidence that Queens was actually named after her, and furthermore a British monarch was an inappropriate subject for a public monument in the United States. Various other groups raised their objections to the statue of Catherine, and the controversy forced Borough President Claire Shulman to withdraw her support, and the statue was never erected.[20][21] A quarter-scale model survives at the site of Expo '98 in Lisbon, Portugal, facing west across the Atlantic.
