The concept of a scientific revolution taking place over an extended period emerged in the eighteenth century in the work of Jean Sylvain Bailly, who saw a two-stage process of sweeping away the old and establishing the new.[7] The beginning of the Scientific Revolution, the 'Scientific Renaissance', was focused on the recovery of the knowledge of the ancients; this is generally considered to have ended in 1632 with publication of Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems.[8] The completion of the Scientific Revolution is attributed to the "grand synthesis" of Isaac Newton's 1687 Principia.  The work formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, thereby completing the synthesis of a new cosmology.[9] By the end of the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment that followed the Scientific Revolution had given way to the "Age of Reflection".
