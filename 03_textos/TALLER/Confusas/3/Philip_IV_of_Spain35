Instead, Philip turned to a better established female mystic, Sister María de Ágreda, a prioress known for her religious writings.[70] He asked her to correspond with him and to advise him in spiritual matters. The two became regular correspondents throughout the remainder of their lives. This is documented in over 600 confidential letters between them over a period of twenty-two years.[14] Philip clearly believed that Maria could intercede with God on his behalf and provide advice on what God wished him to do, to improve Spain's failing fortunes.[70] Most believe that Philip was involved in protecting Maria from the Inquisition's investigation of 1650.[72] Philip's son, as Charles II, protected her writings from later censorship.
