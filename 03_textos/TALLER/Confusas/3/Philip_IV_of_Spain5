At age of 44 in 1649, Philip remarried, following the deaths of both Elisabeth and his only legitimate heir. His choice of his second wife, 14-years-old Maria Anna, also known as Mariana, Philip's niece and the daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III, was guided by politics and Philip's desire to strengthen the relationship with Habsburg Austria.[2] They were married on 7 October 1649. Maria Anna bore him five children, but only two survived to adulthood, a daughter Margarita Teresa, born in 1651, and the future Charles II of Spain in 1661 â€“ but the latter was sickly and considered in frequent danger of dying, making the line of inheritance potentially uncertain.[3]
