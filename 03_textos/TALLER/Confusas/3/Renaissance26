The demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30â€“40% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400.[45] Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.
