The picture of Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers of the early 17th century has proved lasting and influential.[212] Her memory was also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, when the nation again found itself on the brink of invasion.[213] In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the imperial ideology of the day,[206][214] and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat.[215][216] Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress.[217] Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.[218]
