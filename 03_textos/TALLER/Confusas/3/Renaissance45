Some view this as a "scientific revolution", heralding the beginning of the modern age,[67] others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day.[68] Significant scientific advances were made during this time by Galileo Galilei, Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler.[69] Copernicus, in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), posited that the Earth moved around the Sun. De humani corporis fabrica (On the Workings of the Human Body) by Andreas Vesalius, gave a new confidence to the role of dissection, observation, and the mechanistic view of anatomy.[70]
