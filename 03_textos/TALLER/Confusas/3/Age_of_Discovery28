The voyages had a significant and lasting effect on the organization of a maritime network, utilizing and creating nodes and conduits in its wake, thereby restructuring international and cross-cultural relationships and exchanges.[38] It was especially impactful as no other polity had exerted naval dominance over all sectors of the Indian Ocean prior to the these voyages.[39] The Ming promoted alternative nodes as a strategy to establish control over the network.[40] For instance, due to Chinese involvement, ports such as Malacca (in Southeast Asia), Cochin (on the Malabar Coast), and Malindi (on the Swahili Coast) had grown as key alternatives to other important and established ports.[a][41] The appearance of the Ming treasure fleet generated and intensified competition among contending polities and rivals, each seeking an alliance with the Ming.[38]
