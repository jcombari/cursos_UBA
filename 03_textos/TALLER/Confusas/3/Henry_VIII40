Henry's obesity hastened his death at the age of 55, on 28 January 1547 in the Palace of Whitehall, on what would have been his father's 90th birthday. The tomb he had planned (with components taken from the tomb intended for Cardinal Wolsey) was only partly constructed and was never completed. (The sarcophagus and its base were later removed and used for Lord Nelson's tomb in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral.)[149] Henry was interred in a vault at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, next to Jane Seymour.[150] Over 100 years later, King Charles I (1625â€“1649) was buried in the same vault.[151]
