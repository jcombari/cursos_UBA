Great advances in science have been termed "revolutions" since the 18th century. In 1747, the French mathematician Alexis Clairaut wrote that "Newton was said in his own life to have created a revolution".[10] The word was also used in the preface to  Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 work announcing the discovery of oxygen. "Few revolutions in science have immediately excited so much general notice as the introduction of the theory of oxygen ... Lavoisier saw his theory accepted by all the most eminent men of his time, and established over a great part of Europe within a few years from its first promulgation."[11]
