In 1584, Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa founded two colonies in the strait: Nombre de Jesús and Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe. The latter was established north of the strait with 300 settlers.[23][24] That winter, it became known as Puerto del Hambre, or "Port Famine"—most of the settlers were killed by cold or starvation.[25] When Sir Thomas Cavendish landed at the site of Rey Don Felipe in 1587, he found only ruins of the settlement. He renamed it Port Famine.[citation needed]
