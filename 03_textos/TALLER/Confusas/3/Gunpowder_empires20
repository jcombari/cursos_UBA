Turkish arquebuses may have reached China before Portuguese ones.[35] In Zhao Shizhen's book of 1598, the Shenqipu, there were illustrations of Ottoman Turkish musketmen with detailed illustrations of their muskets, alongside European musketeers with detailed illustrations of their muskets.[36] There was also illustration and description of how the Chinese had adopted the Ottoman kneeling position in firing.[24] Zhao Shizhen described the Turkish muskets as being superior to the European muskets.[37] The Wu Pei Chih (1621) later described Turkish muskets that used a rack-and-pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in any European or Chinese firearms at the time.[26]
