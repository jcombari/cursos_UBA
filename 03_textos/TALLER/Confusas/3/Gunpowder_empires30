Though Europe was not mentioned among the gunpowder empires, its contribution to gunpowder technology advancement in the Eurasian region and the world is significant. Though gunpowder did not originate from Europe, advances were made there. Europeans were improving gunpowder a century after the first gun was invented in China and by Chinese.[50] Improved gunpowder from Europe later, in 1520, reached China by a Portuguese ship,[51] though Turkish arquebuses may have reached China before Portuguese ones.[35] The Ottomans and Portuguese introduced the cannon, improved rifles and other advancements to China, hundreds of years after gunpowder's original invention in China, bringing gunpowder's journey through Asia full circle.
