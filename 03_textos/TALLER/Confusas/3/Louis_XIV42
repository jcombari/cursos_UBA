The death of his maternal uncle King Philip IV of Spain, in 1665, precipitated the War of Devolution. In 1660, Louis had married Philip IV's eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as one of the provisions of the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees.[30] The marriage treaty specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants.[30] Mazarin and Lionne, however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 Ã©cus.[31] The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin Charles II of Spain to leave his empire to Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), the grandson of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa.
