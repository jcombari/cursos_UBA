The matchlock arquebus began to be used by the Janissary corps by the 1440s.[20] The musket later appeared in the Ottoman Empire by 1465.[21] Damascus steel was later used in the production of firearms such as the musket from the 16th century.[22] At the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Janissaries equipped with 2000 tüfenks (usually translated as musket) "formed nine consecutive rows and they fired their weapons row by row," in a "kneeling or standing position without the need for additional support or rest."[23] The Chinese later adopted the Ottoman kneeling position for firing.[24] In 1598, Chinese writer Zhao Shizhen described Turkish muskets as being superior to European muskets.[25] The Chinese Wu Pei Chih (1621) later described Turkish muskets that used a rack-and-pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in any European or Chinese firearms at the time.[26]
