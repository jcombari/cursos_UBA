Unlike the Iberians, the British men came with families with whom they planned to permanently live in what is now North America.[23] Because the British colonizers' wives were present, the British men rarely had sexual relations with the native women. While the mestizo and mulatto population make up the majority of people in Latin America today, there is only a small mestizo population in present day North America (excluding Central America).[22]
