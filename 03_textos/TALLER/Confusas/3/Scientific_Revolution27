The term British empiricism came into use to describe philosophical differences perceived between two of its founders Francis Bacon, described as empiricist, and Ren√© Descartes, who was described as a rationalist. Thomas Hobbes, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the philosophy's primary exponents, who developed a sophisticated empirical tradition as the basis of human knowledge.
