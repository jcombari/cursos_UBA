However, Thomas Seymour continued scheming to control the royal family and tried to have himself appointed the governor of the King's person.[25][26] When Parr died after childbirth on 5 September 1548, he renewed his attentions towards Elizabeth, intent on marrying her.[27] Mistress Kat Ashley, who was fond of Thomas Seymour, sought to convince Elizabeth to take him as her husband. She tried to convince Elizabeth to write to Thomas and "comfort him in his sorrow",[28] but Elizabeth claimed that Thomas was not so saddened by her stepmother's death as to need comfort.
