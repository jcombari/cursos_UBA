Tonio Andrade cited that the Military Revolution Model that gave the Europeans so much military success included the use of superior drilling techniques. The drilling technique he was speaking of was the musketeer volley technique.[34] The volley technique was said to have been invented by Japanese Warlord Oda Nobunaga.
