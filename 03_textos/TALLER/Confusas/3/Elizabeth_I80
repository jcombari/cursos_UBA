Recent historians, however, have taken a more complicated view of Elizabeth.[219] Her reign is famous for the defeat of the Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on CÃ¡diz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea.[141] In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record.[220] Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.[221]
