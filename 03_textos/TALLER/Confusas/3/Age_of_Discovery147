Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50â€“90% of their population. (See Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas.)[162]
