The introduction of gunpowder in Europe came through the rich Silk Road Trade in the thirteenth century.[47] During the time, the chemical formula for gunpowder and process of refinement that reached Europe was already in completed form. Roger Bacon, a renowned early European alchemist (1214 â€“ 1292), set forth the marvels of the world and key among them was listing the ingredients of gunpowder which was very instrumental in guiding Europeans in advancing the technology of gunpowder. Having the ingredients revealed to them, European scientists, inventors and alchemists were ready to improve gunpowder and they created corned gunpowder. Corned gunpowder was the same as normal gunpowder in terms of chemical composition but had a different refinement process. This process of mixing entailed adding a wet substance to the gunpowder and then drying it up as a mixture. With this improved gunpowder technology, German friar, Berthold Schwarz invented the first European cannon in 1353.[48] The Europeans improved the gunpowder firearms which had been made in China and Middle East and out of this improvement the Europeans metal-smiths were able to create stronger and more durable rifles using their advanced European metal work techniques.[49] The Europeans also learnt how to calculate the amount of force of the gas that is contained in the gun chamber. The result of this knowledge was that the Europeans made guns that had the power to fire greater distances.[49]
