Early European possessions in what are now referred to as the North and South American continents included Spanish Florida, Spanish New Mexico, Spanish Mesoamerica, Spanish Caribbean, the English colonies of Virginia (with its North Atlantic offshoot, Bermuda) and New England, the French colonies of Acadia, Canada, and Haiti, the Swedish colony of New Sweden, and the Dutch New Netherland. In the 18th century, Denmarkâ€“Norway revived its former colonies in Greenland, while the Russian Empire gained a foothold in Alaska. Denmark-Norway would later make several claims in the Caribbean, starting in the 1600s.
