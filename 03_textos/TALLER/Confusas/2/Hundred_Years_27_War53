With the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trast√°mara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the Battle of Montiel in March 1369. The new Castilian regime provided naval support to French campaigns against Aquitaine and England.[48] In 1372 the Castilian fleet defeated the English fleet in the Battle of La Rochelle.
