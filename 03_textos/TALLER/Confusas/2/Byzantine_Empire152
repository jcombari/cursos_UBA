Many other languages existed in the multi-ethnic Empire, and some of these were given limited official status in their provinces at various times.[254] Notably, by the beginning of the Middle Ages, Syriac had become more widely used by the educated classes in the far eastern provinces.[255] Similarly Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian became significant among the educated in their provinces.[256] Later foreign contacts made Old Church Slavic, Middle Persian, and Arabic important in the Empire and its sphere of influence.[257] There was a revival of Latin studies in the 10th century for the same reason and by the 11th century knowledge of Latin was no longer unusual at Constantinople.[258] There was widespread use of the Armenian and various Slavic languages, which became more pronounced in the border regions of the empire.[254]
