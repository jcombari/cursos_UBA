The root causes of the conflict can be traced to the crisis of 14th-century Europe. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving Gascony, Flanders and Scotland. The question that arose was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.
