After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached legal majority and had the right to decide her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.[162] An exception to her independence was the right to choose a husband, as marriages were normally arranged by the family.[164] The groom would pay a bride-price (mundr) to the bride's family, and the bride brought assets into the marriage, as a dowry.[163] A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.[161][165]
