Traditionally regarded as a Swedish dialect,[135] but by several criteria closer related to West Scandinavian dialects,[136] Elfdalian is a separate language by the standard of mutual intelligibility.[137][138][139] Although there is no mutual intelligibility, due to schools and public administration in Älvdalen being conducted in Swedish, native speakers are bilingual and speak Swedish at a native level. Residents in the area who speak only Swedish as their sole native language, neither speaking nor understanding Elfdalian, are also common. Älvdalen can be said to have had its own alphabet during the 17th and 18th century. Today there are about 2,000-3000 native speakers of Elfdalian.
