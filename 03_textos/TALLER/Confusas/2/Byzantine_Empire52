Leo the Wise died in 912, and hostilities soon resumed as Simeon marched to Constantinople at the head of a large army.[94] Although the walls of the city were impregnable, the Byzantine administration was in disarray and Simeon was invited into the city, where he was granted the crown of basileus (emperor) of Bulgaria and had the young emperor Constantine VII marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered Adrianople.[95] The Empire now faced the problem of a powerful Christian state within a few days' marching distance from Constantinople,[83] as well as having to fight on two fronts.[87]
