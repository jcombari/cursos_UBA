He was named Charles in French and English, Carolus in Latin, after his grandfather, Charles Martel. Later Old French historians dubbed him Charles le Magne (Charles the Great),[10] becoming Charlemagne in English after the Norman conquest of England which changed the English language. The epithet Carolus Magnus was widely used, leading to numerous translations into many languages of Europe.
