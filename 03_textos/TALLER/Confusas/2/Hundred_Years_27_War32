At the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The arri√®re-ban, literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' Robert d'Artois.[18] Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne.
