This led to the Battle of Poitiers (19 September 1356) where his army routed the French.[32] During the battle, the Gascon noble Jean de Grailly, captal de Buch led a mounted unit that was concealed in a forest. The French advance was contained, at which point de Grailly led a flanking movement with his horsemen cutting off the French retreat and succeeding in capturing King John and many of his nobles.[33][34] With John held hostage, his son the Dauphin (later to become Charles V) assumed the powers of the king as regent.[35]
