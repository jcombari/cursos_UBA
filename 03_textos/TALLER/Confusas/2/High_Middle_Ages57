The most significant secular movement was that of the troubadours, who arose in Occitania (Southern France) in the late 11th century. The troubadours were often itinerant, came from all classes of society, and wrote songs on a variety of topics, though with a particular focus on courtly love. Their style went on to influence the trouv√®res of northern France, the minnesingers of Germany, and the composers of secular music of the Trecento in northern Italy.
