The combined information from various sources suggests a diverse cuisine and ingredients. Meat products of all kinds, such as cured, smoked and whey-preserved meat,[183] sausages, and boiled or fried fresh meat cuts, were prepared and consumed.[184] There were plenty of seafood, bread, porridges, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, berries and nuts. Alcoholic drinks like beer, mead, bj√≥rr (a strong fruit wine) and, for the rich, imported wine, were served.[185][186]
