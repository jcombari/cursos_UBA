In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of Calais on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347. This became an important strategic asset for the English, allowing them to keep troops safely in northern France.[27] Calais would remain under English control, even after the end of the Hundred Years' War, until the successful French siege in 1558.[29]
