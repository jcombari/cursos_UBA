Concubinage was also part of Viking society, whereby a woman could live with a man and have children with him without marrying; such a woman was called a frilla.[165] Usually she would be the mistress of a wealthy and powerful man who also had a wife.[160] The wife had authority over the mistresses if they lived in her household.[161] Through her relationship to a man of higher social standing, a concubine and her family could advance socially; although her position was less secure than that of a wife.[160] There was no distinction made between children born inside or outside marriage: both had the right to inherit property from their parents, and there were no "legitimate" or "illegitimate" children.[165] However, children born in wedlock had more inheritance rights than those born out of wedlock.[163]
