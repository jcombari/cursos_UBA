The counterweight trebuchet was invented in the Byzantine Empire during the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (1081â€“1118) under the Komnenian restoration when the Byzantines used this new-developed siege weaponry to devastate citadels and fortifications. This siege artillery marked the apogee of siege weaponry prior to the use of the cannon. From the Byzantines the armies of Europe and Asia eventually learned and adopted this siege weaponry.[209]
