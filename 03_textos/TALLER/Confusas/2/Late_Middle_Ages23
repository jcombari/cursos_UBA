The kingdom of Hungary experienced a golden age during the 14th century.[42] In particular the reigns of the Angevin kings Charles Robert (1308–42) and his son Louis the Great (1342–82) were marked by success.[43] The country grew wealthy as the main European supplier of gold and silver.[44] Louis the Great led successful campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy, and from Poland to Northern Greece.
