Viking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the Eddic poem of Rígsþula, which also explains that it was the God Ríg—father of mankind also known as Heimdallr—who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.[157]
