Bohemia prospered in the 14th century, and the Golden Bull of 1356 made the king of Bohemia first among the imperial electors, but the Hussite revolution threw the country into crisis.[38] The Holy Roman Empire passed to the Habsburgs in 1438, where it remained until its dissolution in 1806.[39] Yet in spite of the extensive territories held by the Habsburgs, the Empire itself remained fragmented, and much real power and influence lay with the individual principalities.[40] In addition, financial institutions, such as the Hanseatic League and the Fugger family, held great power, on both economic and political levels.[41]
