Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna).[166] They were active within art as poets (skalder)[166] and rune masters, and as merchants and medicine women.[166] There may also have been female entrepreneurs, who worked in textile production.[161] Women may also have been active within military office: the tales about shieldmaidens are unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed.[167] These liberties gradually disappeared after the introduction of Christianity,[168] and from the late 13th-century, they are no longer mentioned.[162]
