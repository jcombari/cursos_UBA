The term "feudal" or "feodal" is derived from the medieval Latin word feodum. The etymology of feodum is complex with multiple theories, some suggesting a Germanic origin (the most widely held view) and others suggesting an Arabic origin. Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a beneficium (Latin).[18] Later, the term feudum, or feodum, began to replace beneficium in the documents.[18] The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one-hundred years earlier.[18] The origin of the feudum and why it replaced beneficium has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.[18]
