The English name "Normans" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant,[13] modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann "Northman"[14] or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean "Norseman, Viking".[15]
