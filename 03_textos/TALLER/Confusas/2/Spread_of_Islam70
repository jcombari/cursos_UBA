Byzantine rule was ended by the Arabs, who invaded Tunisia from 647 to 648[62] and Morocco in 682 in the course of their drive to expand the power of Islam. In 670, the Arab general and conqueror Uqba Ibn Nafi established the city of Kairouan (in Tunisia) and its Great Mosque also known as the Mosque of Uqba;[63] the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world.[58] Berber troops were used extensively by the Arabs in their conquest of Spain, which began in 711.
