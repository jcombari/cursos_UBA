Bubonic plague and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War.[4] Normandy lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.[91] The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.[5]
