From 1337, England's attention was largely directed towards France in the Hundred Years' War.[28] Henry V's victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 briefly paved the way for a unification of the two kingdoms, but his son Henry VI soon squandered all previous gains.[29] The loss of France led to discontent at home. Soon after the end of the war in 1453, the dynastic struggles of the Wars of the Roses (c. 1455â€“1485) began, involving the rival dynasties of the House of Lancaster and House of York.[30]
