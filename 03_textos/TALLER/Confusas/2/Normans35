After the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including Bernard de Neufmarch√©, Roger of Montgomery in Shropshire and Hugh Lupus in Cheshire.  These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference.  Norman words, such as baron (barwn), first entered Welsh at that time.
