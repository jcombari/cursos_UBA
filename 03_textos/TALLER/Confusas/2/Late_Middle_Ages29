The Byzantine Empire had for a long time dominated the eastern Mediterranean in politics and culture.[52] By the 14th century, however, it had almost entirely collapsed into a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, centered on the city of Constantinople and a few enclaves in Greece.[53] With the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was permanently extinguished.[54]
