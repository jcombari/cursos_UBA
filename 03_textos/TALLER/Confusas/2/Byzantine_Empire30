After Maurice's murder by Phocas, Khosrau used the pretext to reconquer the Roman province of Mesopotamia.[61] Phocas, an unpopular ruler invariably described in Byzantine sources as a "tyrant", was the target of a number of Senate-led plots. He was eventually deposed in 610 by Heraclius, who sailed to Constantinople from Carthage with an icon affixed to the prow of his ship.[62]
