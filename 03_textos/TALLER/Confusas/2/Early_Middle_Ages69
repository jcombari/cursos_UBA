The study of nature was pursued more for practical reasons than as an abstract inquiry: the need to care for the sick led to the study of medicine and of ancient texts on drugs;[41] the need for monks to determine the proper time to pray led them to study the motion of the stars;[42] and the need to compute the date of Easter led them to study and teach mathematics and the motions of the Sun and Moon.[43][44]
