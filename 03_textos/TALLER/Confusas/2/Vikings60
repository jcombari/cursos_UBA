Runestones attest to voyages to locations such as Bath,[126] Greece (how the Vikings referred to the Byzantium territories generally),[127] Khwaresm,[128] Jerusalem,[129] Italy (as Langobardland),[130] Serkland (i.e. the Muslim world),[131] England[132] (including London[133]), and various places in Eastern Europe. Viking Age inscriptions have also been discovered on the Manx runestones on the Isle of Man.
