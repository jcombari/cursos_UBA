Studies of genetic diversity provide indication of the origin and expansion of the Norse population. Haplogroup I-M253 (defined by specific genetic markers on the Y chromosome) mutation occurs with the greatest frequency among Scandinavian males: 35% in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and peaking at 40% in south-western Finland.[258] It is also common near the southern Baltic and North Sea coasts, and successively decreases further to the south geographically.
