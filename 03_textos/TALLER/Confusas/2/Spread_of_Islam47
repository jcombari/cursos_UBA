H. G. Rawlinson, in his book Ancient and Medieval History of India (ISBNÂ 81-86050-79-5), claims the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century. This fact is corroborated, by J. Sturrock in his South Kanara and Madras Districts Manuals,[36] and also by Haridas Bhattacharya in Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV.[37]
