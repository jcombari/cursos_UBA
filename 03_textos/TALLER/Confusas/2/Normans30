Eventually,[when?] the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions, so much so that Marjorie Chibnall says "writers still referred to Normans and English; but the terms no longer meant the same as in the immediate aftermath of 1066."[37]  In the course of the Hundred Years' War, the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English.  The Anglo-Norman language became distinct from the Latin language, something that was the subject of some humour by Geoffrey Chaucer.  The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see Old English) and influenced it, helping (along with the Norse language of the earlier Anglo-Norse settlers and the Latin used by the church) in the development of Middle English, which, in turn, evolved into Modern English.
