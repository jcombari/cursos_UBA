Most free Viking women were housewives, and the woman's standing in society was linked to that of her husband.[161] Marriage gave a woman a degree of economic security and social standing encapsulated in the title h√∫sfreyja (lady of the house). Norse laws assert the housewife's authority over the 'indoor household'. She had the important roles of managing the farm's resources, conducting business, as well as child-rearing, although some of this would be shared with her husband.[163]
