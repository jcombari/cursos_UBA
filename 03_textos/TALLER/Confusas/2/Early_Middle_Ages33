Due to a complex set of reasons,[which?] conditions in Western Europe began to improve after 700.[3][26] In that year, the two major powers in western Europe were the Franks in Gaul and the Lombards in Italy.[27] The Lombards had been thoroughly Romanized, and their kingdom was stable and well developed. The Franks, in contrast, were barely any different from their barbarian Germanic ancestors. Their kingdom was weak and divided.[28] Impossible to guess at the time, but by the end of the century, the Lombardic kingdom would be extinct, while the Frankish kingdom would have nearly reassembled the Western Roman Empire.[27]
