While the Byzantine Empire had a multi-ethnic character during most of its history[16] and preserved Romano-Hellenistic traditions,[17] it became identified by its western and northern contemporaries with its increasingly predominant Greek element.[18] Western medieval sources also referred to the empire as the "Empire of the Greeks" (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) and to its emperor as Imperator Graecorum (Emperor of the Greeks);[19] these terms were used to distinguish it from the Holy Roman Empire that claimed the prestige of the classical Roman Empire in the West.[20]
