Carthage was accused by both contemporary historians and its adversaries of child sacrifice; Plutarch,[257] Tertullian,[258] Orosius, Philo, and Diodorus Siculus all allege the practice,[259] although Herodotus and Polybius do not. Sceptics contend that if Carthage's critics were aware of such a practice, however limited, they would have been horrified by it and exaggerated its extent due to their polemical treatment of the Carthaginians.[260] According to Charles Picard, Greek and Roman critics objected not to the killing of children but to its religious context: in both ancient Greece and Rome, inconvenient newborns were commonly killed by exposure to the elements.[261] The Hebrew Bible mentions child sacrifice practiced by the Canaanites, ancestors of the Carthaginians, while Greek sources allege that the Phoenicians sacrificed the sons of princes during times of "grave peril".[262] However, archaeological evidence of human sacrifice in the Levant remains sparse.[262]
