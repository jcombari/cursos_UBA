Like virtually all ancient societies, the Carthaginians worshiped numerous gods and goddesses, each presiding over a particular theme or aspect of nature.[241] The Carthaginians practiced the Phoenician religion, a polytheist belief system derived from the ancient Semitic religions of the Levant. Although most major deities were brought from the Phoenician homeland, Carthage gradually developed unique customs, divinities, and styles of worship that became central to its distinct identity.
