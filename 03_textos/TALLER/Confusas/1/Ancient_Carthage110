Carthage's economy began as an extension of that of its parent city, Tyre.[192] Its massive merchant fleet traversed the trade routes mapped out by Tyre, and Carthage inherited from Tyre the trade in the extremely valuable dye Tyrian purple.[193] No evidence of purple dye manufacture has been found at Carthage, but mounds of shells of the murex marine snails, from which it derived, have been found in excavations of the Punic town of Kerkouane, at Dar Essafi on Cap Bon.[194] Similar mounds of murex have also been found at Djerba[195] on the Gulf of Gabes[196] in Tunisia. Strabo mentions the purple dye-works of Djerba[197] as well as those of the ancient city of Zouchis.[198][199][200] The purple dye became one of the most highly valued commodities in the ancient Mediterranean,[201] being worth fifteen to twenty times its weight in gold. In Roman society, where adult males wore the toga as a national garment, the use of the toga praetexta, decorated with a stripe of Tyrian purple about two to three inches in width along its border, was reserved for magistrates and high priests. Broad purple stripes (latus clavus) were reserved for the togas of the senatorial class, while the equestrian class had the right to wear narrow stripes (angustus clavus).[202][203]
