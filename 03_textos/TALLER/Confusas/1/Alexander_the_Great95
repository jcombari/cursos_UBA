Some of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents. His mother had huge ambitions, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire.[189] Olympias' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him,[195] and Plutarch tells how his ambition "kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years".[196] However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds.[48] Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to outdo his father, illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle.[189] While Alexander worried that his father would leave him "no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world",[197] he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions.[189]
