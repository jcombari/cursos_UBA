Carthage's republican system appears to have extended to the rest of its empire, though to what extent and in what form is unknown. The term sufet was used for officials throughout its colonies and territories; inscriptions from Punic-era Sardinia are dated with four names: the sufetes of the island as well as of Carthage.[144] This suggests some degree of political coordination between local and colonial Carthaginians, perhaps through a regional hierarchy of sufetes.
