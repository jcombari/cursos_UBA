Julius Caesar is seen as the main example of Caesarism, a form of political rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality, whose rationale is the need to rule by force, establishing a violent social order, and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government.[157] Other people in history, such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini, have defined themselves as Caesarists.[158][159] Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesar's military career but also on his relation with the masses, a predecessor to populism.[160] The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.
