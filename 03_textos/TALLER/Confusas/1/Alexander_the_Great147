The figure of Dhul-Qarnayn (literally "the Two-Horned One") mentioned in the Quran is believed by scholars to be based on later legends of Alexander.[273] In this tradition, he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of Gog and Magog.[275] He then travelled the known world in search of the Water of Life and Immortality, eventually becoming a prophet.[275]
