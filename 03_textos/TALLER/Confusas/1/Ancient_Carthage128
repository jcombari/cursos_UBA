Modern archaeology in formerly Punic areas has discovered a number of large cemeteries for children and infants, representing a civic and religious institution for worship and sacrifice; these sites are called the tophet by archaeologists, as their Punic name is unknown. These cemeteries may have been used as graves for stillborn infants or children who died very early.[266] Excavations have been interpreted by many scholars as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice.[267][268] An estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 and 200 BC in the tophet discovered in the Salammb√¥ neighbourhood of present-day Carthage, with the practice continuing until the second century.[269] The majority of urns in this site, as well as in similar sites in Motya and Tharros, contained the charred bones of infants or fetuses; in rarer instances, the remains of children between the ages of two and four have been found.[270] The bones of animals, particularly lambs, are also common, especially in earlier deposits.[270]
