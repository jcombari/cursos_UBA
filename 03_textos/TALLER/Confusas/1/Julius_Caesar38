The Forum of Caesar, with its Temple of Venus Genetrix, was then built, among many other public works.[96] Caesar also tightly regulated the purchase of state-subsidised grain and reduced the number of recipients to a fixed number, all of whom were entered into a special register.[97] From 47 to 44Â BC, he made plans for the distribution of land to about 15,000 of his veterans.[98]
