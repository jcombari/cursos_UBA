Geometers such as Archimedes (c. 287 – 212 BCE), Apollonius of Perga (c. 262 – c. 190 BCE), and Euclid (c. 325 – 265 BCE), whose Elements became the most important textbook in mathematics until the 19th century, built upon the work of the Hellenic era Pythagoreans. Eratosthenes used his knowledge of geometry to measure the distance between the Sun and the Earth along with the size of the Earth.[28]
