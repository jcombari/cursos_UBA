The conflict proved to be a major turning point for Carthage. Though it would retain some presence in Sicily, most of the island would remain in Greek (and later Roman) hands. The Carthaginians would never again expand their territory or sphere of influence on the island to any meaningful degree, instead turning their attention to securing or increasing their hold in North Africa and Iberia.[65][66] The death of King Hamilcar and the disastrous conduct of the war also prompted political reforms that established an oligarchic republic.[67] Carthage would henceforth constrain its rulers through assemblies of both nobles and the common people.
