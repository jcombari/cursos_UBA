The earliest Greek philosophers, known as the pre-Socratics, were materialists who provided alternative answers to the same question found in the myths of their neighbors: "How did the ordered cosmos in which we live come to be?"[5]  But although the question is much the same, their answers and their attitude towards the answers is markedly different.  As reported by such later writers as Aristotle, their explanations tended to center on the material source of things.
