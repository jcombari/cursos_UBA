Sumerians harvested during the spring in three-person teams consisting of a reaper, a binder, and a sheaf handler.[80] The farmers would use threshing wagons, driven by oxen, to separate the cereal heads from the stalks and then use threshing sleds to disengage the grain. They then winnowed the grain/chaff mixture.
