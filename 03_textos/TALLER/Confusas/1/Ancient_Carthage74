Unique among rulers in antiquity, the sufetes had no power over the military: generals (rb mhnt or rab mahanet) became a separate political office beginning in the sixth century BC, either appointed by the administration or elected by citizens.[129] In contrast to Rome and Greece, military and political power were separate, and it was rare for a sufete to also be a general.[129] Generals did not serve fixed terms, as there were usually selected to serve for the duration of a war.[129] However, a family that dominated the sufetes could install relatives or allies to the generalship, as was the case with the Barcid dynasty.[129]
