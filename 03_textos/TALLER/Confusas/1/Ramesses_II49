In film, Ramesses is played by Yul Brynner in Cecil B. DeMille's classic The Ten Commandments (1956). Here Ramesses is portrayed as a vengeful tyrant as well as the main antagonist of the film, ever scornful of his father's preference for Moses over "the son of [his] body".[89]  The animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998) also features a depiction of Ramesses (voiced by Ralph Fiennes), portrays Moses' adoptive brother, and ultimately as the film's villain with essentially the same motivations as in the earlier 1956 film. Joel Edgerton played Ramesses in the 2014 film Exodus: Gods and Kings. SÃ©rgio Marone plays Ramesses in the 2015 Brazilian series Os Dez Mandamentos (English: Moses and the Ten Commandments).
