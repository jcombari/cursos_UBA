Around the first century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet with the addition of some Demotic signs.[121] Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine[122] and Islamic periods in Egypt,[123] but only in the 1820s, after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, were hieroglyphs substantially deciphered.[124]
