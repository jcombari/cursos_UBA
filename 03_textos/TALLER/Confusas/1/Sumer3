The term "Sumer" (ð’‹—ð’ˆ¨ð’Š’, Sumerian: eme.gi7, Akkadian: Å umeru) is the name given to the land of the "Sumerians", the ancient non-Semitic-speaking inhabitants of southern Mesopotamia, by their successors the East Semitic-speaking Akkadians.[6][7][8] The Sumerians themselves referred to their land as Kengir, the 'Country of the noble lords' (ð’† ð’‚—ð’„€, k-en-gi(-r), lit. 'country' + 'lords' + 'noble') as seen in their inscriptions.[6][9][10]
