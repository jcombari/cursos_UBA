While Boudica's army continued their assault in Verulamium (St. Albans), Suetonius regrouped his forces. According to Tacitus, he amassed a force including his own Legio XIV Gemina, some vexillationes (detachments) of the XX Valeria Victrix, and any available auxiliaries.[36] The prefect of Legio II Augusta, Poenius Postumus, ignored the call,[37] and a fourth legion, IX Hispana, had been routed trying to relieve Camulodunum,[38] but nonetheless the governor now commanded an army of almost ten thousand men.
