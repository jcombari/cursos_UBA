Between his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44Â BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals.[91] First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit.[91]
