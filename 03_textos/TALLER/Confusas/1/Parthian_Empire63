Usually made of silver,[218] the Greek drachma coin, including the tetradrachm, was the standard currency used throughout the Parthian Empire.[219] The Arsacids maintained royal mints at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana.[40] They most likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well.[24] From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5 g or more than 4.2 g.[220] The first Parthian tetradrachms, weighing in principle around 16 g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia.[221]
