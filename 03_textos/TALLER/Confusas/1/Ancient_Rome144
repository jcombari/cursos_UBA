The youth of Rome had several forms of athletic play and exercise, such as jumping, wrestling, boxing, and racing.[233] In the countryside, pastimes for the wealthy also included fishing and hunting.[234] The Romans also had several forms of ball playing, including one resembling handball.[233] Dice games, board games, and gamble games were popular pastimes.[233] Women did not take part in these activities. For the wealthy, dinner parties presented an opportunity for entertainment, sometimes featuring music, dancing, and poetry readings.[225] Plebeians sometimes enjoyed similar parties through clubs or associations, but for most Romans, recreational dining usually meant patronizing taverns.[225] Children entertained themselves with toys and such games as leapfrog.[234][225]
