The extent of Arsacid patronage of Zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship.[241] The followers of Zoroaster would have found the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable.[234] However, there is evidence that Vologases I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the Avesta.[242] The Sasanian court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.[243]
