According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature,[198] which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions.[189] Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate.[199] He had a calmer sideâ€”perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader.[200] This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn.[189] His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general.[198] He had great self-restraint in "pleasures of the body", in contrast with his lack of self-control with alcohol.[201]
