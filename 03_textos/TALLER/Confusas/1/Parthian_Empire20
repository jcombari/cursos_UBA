The Yuezhi Kushan Empire in northern India largely guaranteed the security of Parthia's eastern border.[67] Thus, from the mid-1st century BC onwards, the Arsacid court focused on securing the western border, primarily against Rome.[67] A year following Mithridates II's subjugation of Armenia, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, the Roman proconsul of Cilicia, convened with the Parthian diplomat Orobazus at the Euphrates river. The two agreed that the river would serve as the border between Parthia and Rome, although several historians have argued that Sulla only had authority to communicate these terms back to Rome.[68]
