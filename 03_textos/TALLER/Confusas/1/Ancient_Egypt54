The Egyptian language is a northern Afro-Asiatic language closely related to the Berber and Semitic languages.[108] It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200Â BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.[109] Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.[110]
