In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia.[112] Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire.[113] However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's strength, greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171â€“168 BC).[16]
