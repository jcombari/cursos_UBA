Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[107] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[107] Slavery was hereditary[citation needed], though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[107] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[108] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for "female slave", cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[109]
