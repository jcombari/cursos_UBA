Uruk, one of Sumer's largest cities, has been estimated to have had a population of 50,000â€“80,000 at its height;[48] given the other cities in Sumer, and the large agricultural population, a rough estimate for Sumer's population might be 0.8 million to 1.5 million. The world population at this time has been estimated at about 27 million.[49]
