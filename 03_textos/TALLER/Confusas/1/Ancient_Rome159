Examined individuals from Rome during the time of the Roman Empire (27 BCE â€“ 300 CE) bore almost no genetic resemblance to Rome's founding populations, and were instead shifted towards the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East.[256] The Imperial population of Rome was found to have been extremely diverse, with barely any of the examined individuals being of primarily European ancestry.[257] It was suggested that the observed genetic replacement of Rome's founding populations was a result of heavy migration of merchants and slaves from the populous urban centres of the Middle East.[258] During late antiquity, Rome's population was drastically reduced as a result of political instability, epidemics and economic changes. Repeated invasions of barbarians brought European ancestry back into Rome, resulting in the loss of genetic link to the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East.[257] By the Middle Ages, the people of Rome again genetically resembled European populations.[257]
