Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with Arabic.[115] The word order is .mw-parser-output span.smallcaps{font-variant:small-caps}.mw-parser-output span.smallcaps-smaller{font-size:85%}predicate–subject in verbal and adjectival sentences, and subject–predicate in nominal and adverbial sentences.[116] The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.[117] Verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n, but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. Stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).[118]
