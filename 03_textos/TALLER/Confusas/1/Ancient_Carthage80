Carthage reportedly had a constitution of some form. Aristotle compare's Carthage's constitution favorably to its well regarded Spartan counterpart, describing it as sophisticated, functional, and fulfilling "all needs of moderation and justice".[141][142] Eratosthenes, a Greek polymath and head of the Library of Alexandria, praises the Carthaginians as among the few barbarians to be refined and "admirably" governed.[143] Some scholars suggest the Greeks generally held Carthage's institutions in high regard, regarding the Carthaginians as close to equal.[136]
