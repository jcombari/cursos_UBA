At Issus in 333Â BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through.[185] Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army.[186] At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.[185]
