Parthian history can also be reconstructed via the Chinese historical records of events.[185] In contrast to Greek and Roman histories, the early Chinese histories maintained a more neutral view when describing Parthia,[186] although the habit of Chinese chroniclers to copy material for their accounts from older works (of undetermined origin) makes it difficult to establish a chronological order of events.[187] The Chinese called Parthia Ānxī (Chinese: 安 息, Old Chinese pronunciation: 'ansjək), perhaps after the Greek name for the Parthian city Antiochia in Margiana (Greek: Ἀντιόχεια ἡ ἐν τῇ Μαργιανῇ).[188] However, this could also have been a transliteration of "Arsaces", after the dynasty's eponymous founder.[189] The works and historical authors include the Shiji (also known as the Records of the Grand Historian) by Sima Qian, the Han shu (Book of Han) by Ban Biao, Ban Gu, and Ban Zhao, and the Hou Han shu (Book of Later Han) by Fan Ye.[190] They provide information on the nomadic migrations leading up to the early Saka invasion of Parthia and valuable political and geographical information.[185] For example, the Shiji (ch. 123) describes diplomatic exchanges, exotic gifts given by Mithridates II to the Han court, types of agricultural crops grown in Parthia, production of wine using grapes, itinerant merchants, and the size and location of Parthian territory.[191] The Shiji also mentions that the Parthians kept records by "writing horizontally on strips of leather," that is, parchment.[192]
