Circumstantial evidence suggests that Carthage developed viticulture and wine production before the fourth century BC,[234] and exported its wines widely, as indicated by distinctive cigar-shaped Carthaginian amphorae found at archaeological sites across the western Mediterranean, although the contents of these vessels have not been conclusively analysed.[235][236] Carthage also shipped large quantities of raisin wine, known in Latin as passum, which was popular in antiquity, including among the Romans.[237] Fruits such as figs, pears, and pomegranates—which the Romans called "Punic Apples"—as well as nuts, grain, grapes, dates, and olives were grown in the extensive hinterland;[238] olive oil was processed and exported all over the Mediterranean. Carthage also raised fine horses, the ancestors of today's Barb horses, which are considered the most influential racing breed after the Arabian.[239][240]
