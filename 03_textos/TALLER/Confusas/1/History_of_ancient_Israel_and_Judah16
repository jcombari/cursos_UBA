In the 7th century Jerusalem grew to contain a population many times greater than earlier and achieved clear dominance over its neighbours.[39] This occurred at the same time that Israel was being destroyed by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and was probably the result of a cooperative arrangement with the Assyrians to establish Judah as an Assyrian vassal state controlling the valuable olive industry.[39] Judah prospered as a vassal state (despite a disastrous rebellion against Sennacherib), but in the last half of the 7th centuryÂ BCE, Assyria suddenly collapsed, and the ensuing competition between Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for control of the land led to the destruction of Judah in a series of campaigns between 597 and 582.[39]
