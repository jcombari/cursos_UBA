Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[83] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[84][85][86][87] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[88][89] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.
