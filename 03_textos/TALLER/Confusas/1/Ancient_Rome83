The imperial city of Rome was the largest urban center in the empire, with a population variously estimated from 450,000 to close to one million.[161][162][163] The public spaces in Rome resounded with such a din of hooves and clatter of iron chariot wheels that Julius Caesar had once proposed a ban on chariot traffic during the day. Historical estimates show that around 20 percent of the population under jurisdiction of ancient Rome (25â€“40%, depending on the standards used, in Roman Italy)[164] lived in innumerable urban centers, with population of 10,000 and more and several military settlements, a very high rate of urbanization by pre-industrial standards. Most of those centers had a forum, temples, and other buildings similar to Rome's.  Average life expectancy was about 28.[165][timeframe?]
