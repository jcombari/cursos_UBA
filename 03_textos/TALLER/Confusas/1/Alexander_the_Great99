He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself.[148] Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus,[208] a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa.[209] He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon.[209] Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform.[105] This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen.[210] However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine.[211] Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.[212]
