Although Greek culture of the Seleucids was widely adopted by peoples of the Near East during the Hellenistic period, the Parthian era witnessed an Iranian cultural revival in religion, the arts, and even clothing fashions.[222] Conscious of both the Hellenistic and Persian cultural roots of their kingship, the Arsacid rulers styled themselves after the Persian King of Kings and affirmed that they were also philhellenes ("friends of the Greeks").[223] The word "philhellene" was inscribed on Parthian coins until the reign of Artabanus II.[224] The discontinuation of this phrase signified the revival of Iranian culture in Parthia.[225] Vologases I was the first Arsacid ruler to have the Parthian script and language appear on his minted coins alongside the now almost illegible Greek.[226] However, the use of Greek-alphabet legends on Parthian coins remained until the collapse of the empire.[227]
