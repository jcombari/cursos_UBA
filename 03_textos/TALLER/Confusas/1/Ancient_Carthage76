According to Aristotle, a special judicial tribunal known as the One Hundred and Four (𐤌𐤀𐤕 or miat) served as Carthage's "highest constitutional authority".[131] Although he compares it to the ephors of Sparta, a council of elders that held considerable political power, the tribunal's primary function was overseeing the actions of generals and other officials to ensure they were serving the best interests of the republic.[126] The One Hundred and Four had the power to impose fines and even crucifixion as punishment. It also formed panels of special commissioners, called pentarchies, to deal with various state affairs.[130] Numerous junior officials and special commissioners were responsible for different aspects of government, such as public works, tax collection, and the administration of the state treasury.[130][132]
