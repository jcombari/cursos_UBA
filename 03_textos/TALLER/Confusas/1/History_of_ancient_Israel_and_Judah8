The name "Israel" first appears in the Merneptah Stele c. 1209Â BCE: "Israel is laid waste and his seed is no more."[19] This "Israel" was a cultural and probably political entity, well enough established for the Egyptians to perceive it as a possible challenge, but an ethnic group rather than an organised state.[20]
