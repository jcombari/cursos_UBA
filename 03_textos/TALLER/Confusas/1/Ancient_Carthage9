It is unclear what term, if any, the Carthaginians used to refer to themselves. The Phoenician homeland in the Levant was natively known as 𐤐𐤕 (Pūt) and its people as the 𐤐𐤍𐤉𐤌 (Pōnnim). Ancient Egyptians accounts suggest the people from the region identified as Kenaani or Kinaani, equivalent to Canaanite.[12] A passage from Augustine has often been interpreted as indicating that the Punic-speakers in North Africa called themselves Chanani (Canaanites),[13] but it has recently been argued that this is a misreading.[14] Numismatic evidence from Sicily shows that some western Phoenicians made use of the term Phoinix.[15]
