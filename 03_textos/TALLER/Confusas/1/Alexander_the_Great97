Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences.[196][200] However, he had little interest in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos).[202] He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader.[175][198] His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.[175]
