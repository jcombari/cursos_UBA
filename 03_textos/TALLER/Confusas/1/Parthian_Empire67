The Parthian Empire, being culturally and politically heterogeneous, had a variety of religious systems and beliefs, the most widespread being those dedicated to Greek and Iranian cults.[234] Aside from a minority of Jews[235] and early Christians,[236] most Parthians were polytheistic.[237] Greek and Iranian deities were often blended together as one. For example, Zeus was often equated with Ahura Mazda, Hades with Angra Mainyu, Aphrodite and Hera with Anahita, Apollo with Mithra, and Hermes with Shamash.[238] Aside from the main gods and goddesses, each ethnic group and city had their own designated deities.[237] As with Seleucid rulers,[239] Parthian art indicates that the Arsacid kings viewed themselves as gods; this cult of the ruler was perhaps the most widespread.[240]
