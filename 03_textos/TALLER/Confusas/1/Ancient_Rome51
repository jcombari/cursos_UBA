Tiberius died (or was killed)[74] in 37 AD. The male line of the Julio-Claudians was limited to Tiberius' nephew Claudius, his grandson Tiberius Gemellus and his grand-nephew Caligula. As Gemellus was still a child, Caligula was chosen to rule the Empire. He was a popular leader in the first half of his reign, but became a crude and insane tyrant in his years controlling government.[75][76] Suetonius states that he committed incest with his sisters, killed some men just for amusement and nominated a horse for a consulship.[77] The Praetorian Guard murdered Caligula four years after the death of Tiberius,[78] and, with belated support from the senators, proclaimed his uncle Claudius as the new emperor.[79] Claudius was not as authoritarian as Tiberius and Caligula. Claudius conquered Lycia and Thrace; his most important deed was the beginning of the conquest of Britannia.[80] Claudius was poisoned by his wife, Agrippina the Younger in 54 AD.[81] His heir was Nero, son of Agrippina and her former husband, since Claudius' son Britannicus had not reached manhood upon his father's death.
