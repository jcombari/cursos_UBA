In an effort to maintain world peace,[304] the Allies formed the United Nations, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,[305] and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations.[306] The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the permanent members of the UN's Security Council.[307] The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.[308]
