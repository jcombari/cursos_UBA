During the Napoleonic Wars he was taken seriously by the British press as a dangerous tyrant, poised to invade. Napoleon was mocked in British newspapers as a short tempered small man and he was nicknamed "Little Boney in a strong fit".[261] A nursery rhyme warned children that Bonaparte ravenously ate naughty people; the "bogeyman".[262] At 1.57 metres (5 ft 2 in), he was the height of an average French male but short for an aristocrat or officer (part of why he was assigned to the artillery, since at the time the infantry and cavalry required more commanding figures).[263]  It is possible he was taller at 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) due to the difference in the French measurement of inches.[264]
