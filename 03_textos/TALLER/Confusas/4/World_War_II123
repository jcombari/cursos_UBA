Aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);[394] and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).[395] Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.[396] Although guided missiles were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably target aircraft until some years after the war.
