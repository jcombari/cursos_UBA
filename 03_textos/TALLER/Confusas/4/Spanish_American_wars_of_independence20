The loss of high offices to Peninsulars and the eighteenth-century revolts in Spanish South America were the some of the direct causes of the wars of independence, which took place decades later, but they have been considered important elements of the political background in which the wars took place.[23] Many Creoles, particularly the wealthy creoles, were negatively impacted by the Bourbon Reforms.[9] This resulted in their taking action by using their wealth and positions within society, often as leaders within their communities, to spur resistance to convey their displeasure with Spanish reforms because of the negative economic impact which they had.[24] However, because of how quickly their revolts would further radicalize the lower classes, the Creoles quickly stopped supporting general violent insurrection because they benefitted from social change that occurred through the systems of the Spanish crown.[24] Institutional change ensured stability by supporting the political institutions that allowed for the creation of a wealthy Creole class and further adapting those institutions to meet demands, rather than propose a radical shift in the complete make-up of socioeconomic life and traditions.[24] However, institutional change did not come as anticipated and further spurred on the radicalization of Spanish-American social classes towards independence.[9]
