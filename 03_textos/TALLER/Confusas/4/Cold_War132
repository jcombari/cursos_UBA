The term new Cold War refers to the period of intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant.[286] Diggins says, "Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world."[287] Cox says, "The intensity of this 'second' Cold War was as great as its duration was short."[288]
