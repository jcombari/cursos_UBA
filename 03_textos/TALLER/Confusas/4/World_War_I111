British and Dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the Battle of Albert on 21 August.[214] The assault was widened by French[213] and then further British forces in the following days. During the last week of August the Allied pressure along a 110-kilometre (68Â mi) front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, "Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines."[212]
