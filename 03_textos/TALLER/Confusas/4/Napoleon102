The French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the Russian Winter. The Arm√©e had begun as over 400,000 frontline troops, with fewer than 40,000 crossing the Berezina River in November 1812.[177] The Russians had lost 150,000 soldiers in battle and hundreds of thousands of civilians.[178]
