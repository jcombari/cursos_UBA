Napoleon maintained strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing what needed to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted.[245] He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, "Give me lucky generals", arguing that "luck" comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it.[246] Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805â€“06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility.[247] "I am of the race that founds empires" he once boasted, deeming himself an heir to the Ancient Romans.[248]
