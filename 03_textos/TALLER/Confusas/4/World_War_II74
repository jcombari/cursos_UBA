In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein[212] and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta.[213] A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.[214] This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, which resulted in the region joining the Allies.[215] Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France;[215] although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces.[215][216] The Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.[215][217]
