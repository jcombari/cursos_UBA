Historians emphasize the strength of the ambition that took Napoleon from an obscure village to command of most of Europe.[240] In-depth academic studies about his early life conclude that up until age 2, he had a "gentle disposition".[22] His older brother, Joseph, frequently received their mother's attention which made Napoleon more assertive and approval-driven. During his early schooling years he would be harshly bullied by classmates for his Corsican identity and control of the French language. To withstand the stress he became domineering, eventually developing an inferiority complex.[22]
