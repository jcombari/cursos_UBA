On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,[226] giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.[227][228] The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Pantherâ€“Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper Offensive.[229]
