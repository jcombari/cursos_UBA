The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 occurred shortly after Khrushchev arranged the removal of Hungary's Stalinist leader Mátyás Rákosi.[155] In response to a popular uprising,[J] the new regime formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Army invaded.[156] Thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union,[157] and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos.[158] Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials.[K]
