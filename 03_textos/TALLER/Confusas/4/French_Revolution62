On 20 September, the French army won a stunning victory over the Prussians at Valmy. Emboldened by this, on 22 September the Convention abolished the monarchy and established the French First Republic. It also introduced a new calendar, and 1792 became Year One of the new republic.[96] The next few months were taken up with the trial of Citoyen Louis Capet, formerly Louis XVI. Members of the convention were evenly divided on the question of his guilt, but increasingly influenced by radicals concentrated in the Jacobin clubs and Paris Commune. The Brunswick Manifesto made it easy to portray Louis as a threat to the Revolution, confirmed when extracts from his personal correspondence allegedly showed him conspiring with Royalist exiles serving in their[clarification needed] armies.[97]
