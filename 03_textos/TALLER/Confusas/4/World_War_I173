Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination.[344][345][346] At least 250,000 Assyrian Christians, about half of the population, and 350,000â€“750,000 Anatolian and Pontic Greeks were killed between 1915 and 1922.[347]
