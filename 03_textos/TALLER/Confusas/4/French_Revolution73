At the height of the Terror, the slightest hint of counter-revolutionary thought could place one under suspicion, and even its supporters were not immune. Under the pressure of events, splits appeared within the Montagnard faction, with violent disagreements between radical Hébertists and moderates led by Danton.[c] Robespierre saw their dispute as de-stabilising the regime, and as a deist he objected to the anti-religious policies advocated by the atheist Hébert. He was arrested and executed on 24 March with 19 of his colleagues, including Carrier.[115] To retain the loyalty of the remaining Hébertists, Danton was arrested and executed on 5 April  with Camille Desmoulins, after a show trial that arguably did more damage to Robespierre than any other act in this period.[116]
