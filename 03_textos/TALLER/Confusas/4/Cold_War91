On the nuclear weapons front, the United States and the USSR pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long-range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other.[43] In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),[191] and in October they launched the first Earth satellite, Sputnik 1.[192] The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the Space Race. This led to the Apollo Moon landings by the United States, which astronaut Frank Borman later described as "just a battle in the Cold War."[193]
