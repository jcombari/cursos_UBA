Few events in historical research have been as conditioned by political influences as the October Revolution. The historiography of the Revolution generally divides into three camps: the Soviet-Marxist view, the Western-Totalitarian view, and the Revisionist view.[59] Since the fall of Communism (and the USSR) in Russia in 1991, the Western-Totalitarian view has again become dominant and the Soviet-Marxist view has practically vanished.[60] While the Soviet-Marxist view has been largely discredited, an "anti-Stalinist" version of it attempts to draw a distinction between the "Lenin period" (1917–23) and the "Stalin period" (1923–53).[61]
