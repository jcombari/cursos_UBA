Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast.[204] By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, Operation Crusader, in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made.[205] In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala line by early February,[206] followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives.[207] Concerns the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942.[208] An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein.[209] On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous Dieppe Raid,[210] demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.[211][pageÂ needed]
