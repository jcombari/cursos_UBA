Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter.[85] Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance,[86] while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations,[87] adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-nuclear movement.[88]
