George F. E. Rud√© stresses his "rare combination of will, intellect and physical vigour".[241] In one-on-one situations he typically had a hypnotic effect on people, seemingly bending the strongest leaders to his will.[242] He understood military technology, but was not an innovator in that regard.[243] He was an innovator in using the financial, bureaucratic, and diplomatic resources of France. He could rapidly dictate a series of complex commands to his subordinates, keeping in mind where major units were expected to be at each future point, and like a chess master, "seeing" the best plays moves ahead.[244]
