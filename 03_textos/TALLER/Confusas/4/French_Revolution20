610 deputies sat for the Third Estate, in theory representing 95% of the population, although voting rights were restricted to French-born or naturalised male taxpayers, aged 25 or more, residing where the vote was to take place. Half were well-educated lawyers or local officials, nearly a third in trades or industry, while fifty-one were wealthy land owners.[32]
