The cause of his death has been debated. Napoleon's physician, Fran√ßois Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found the cause of death to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the official report.[215] Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was apparently unknown at the time of the autopsy.[216] Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.[210]
