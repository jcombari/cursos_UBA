The new states that began to take root in Latin America, particularly Mexico, often courted foreign financial support from European nations.[68] This foreign investment often came via loans, which only continued to cripple economies that had been destroyed or left alone during conflict.[68] This investment was not enough to support economic recovery and can be considered to have only further negatively impacted economic growth in these newly developing states by pushing them further into debt in an attempt to recover and grow their economies.[68] As the newly independent nations finally entered the world economy after the end of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when the economies of Europe and the United States were recovering and aggressively seeking new markets to sell their products after more than two decades of disruption. Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the world markets as an exporter of raw materials and a consumer of finished products.[69]
