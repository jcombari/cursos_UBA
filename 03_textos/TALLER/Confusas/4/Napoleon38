General Bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at Alexandria on 1 July.[35] He fought the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks, Egypt's ruling military caste. This helped the French practise their defensive tactic for the Battle of the Pyramids, fought on 21 July, about 24 km (15 mi) from the pyramids. General Bonaparte's forces of 25,000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks' Egyptian cavalry. Twenty-nine French[70] and approximately 2,000 Egyptians were killed. The victory boosted the morale of the French army.[71]
