The French Revolution abolished many of the constraints on the economy that had slowed growth in the Ancien r√©gime. It abolished tithes owed to local churches and feudal dues owed to landlords. The results hurt tenants, who paid both higher rents and higher taxes.[186] It nationalised all church lands, as well as lands of royalists who went into exile. It planned to use these seized lands to finance the government by issuing assignats. It abolished the guild system as a worthless remnant of feudalism.[187] It also abolished the highly inefficient system of tax farming, whereby private individuals would collect taxes for a hefty fee. The government seized the foundations that had been set up (starting in the 13th century) to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals, poor relief, and education. The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation's charitable and school systems were massively disrupted.[188]
