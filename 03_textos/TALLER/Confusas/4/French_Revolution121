Napoleon after 1799 paid for his expensive wars by multiple means, starting with the modernisation of the rickety financial system.[190] He conscripted soldiers at low wages, raised taxes, placed large-scale loans, sold lands formerly owned by the Catholic Church, sold Louisiana to the United States, plundered conquered areas and seized food supplies, and levied requisitions on countries he controlled, such as Italy.[191]
