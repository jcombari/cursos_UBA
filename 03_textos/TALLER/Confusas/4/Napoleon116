Napoleon's forces fought two Coalition armies, commanded by the British Duke of Wellington and the Prussian Prince Bl√ºcher, at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815. Wellington's army withstood repeated attacks by the French and drove them from the field while the Prussians arrived in force and broke through Napoleon's right flank.
