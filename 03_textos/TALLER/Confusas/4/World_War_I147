In the aftermath of World War I, Greece fought against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the Treaty of Lausanne.[297] According to various sources,[298] several hundred thousand Greeks died during this period, which was tied in with the Greek Genocide.[299]
