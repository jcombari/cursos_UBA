Napoleon was routinely bullied by his peers for his accent, birthplace, short stature, mannerisms and inability to speak French quickly.[22] Bonaparte became reserved and melancholy applying himself to reading. An examiner observed that Napoleon "has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics. He is fairly well acquainted with history and geographyÂ ... This boy would make an excellent sailor".[b][28] In early adulthood, he briefly intended to become a writer; he authored a history of Corsica and a romantic novella.[18]
