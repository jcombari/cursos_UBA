After two months of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the British Royal Navy. He decided on a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India.[35] Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, linking with Tipu Sultan, the Sultan of Mysore that fought the long four Anglo-Mysore Wars during the British invasion of India.[65] Napoleon assured the Directory that "as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions".[66] The Directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to India.[67]
