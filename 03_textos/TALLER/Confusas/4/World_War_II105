Recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the Marshall Plan (1948â€“1951) both directly and indirectly caused.[325][326] The post-1948 West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle.[327] Italy also experienced an economic boom[328] and the French economy rebounded.[329] By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,[330] and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country,[331] it continued in relative economic decline for decades.[332]
