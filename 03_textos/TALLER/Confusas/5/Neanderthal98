In 1971, cognitive scientist Philip Lieberman reconstructed the Neanderthal vocal tract as similar to that of a newborn and incapable of producing nasal sounds, because they had a large mouth and thus lacked the necessity for a descended larynx to fit the entire tongue inside the mouth. He then concluded that they were anatomically unable to produce the sounds /a/, /i/, /u/, /ɔ/, /g/, and /k/ and thus lacked the capacity for articulate speech, albeit still capable of speech at a level higher than non-human primates.[322][323][324] However, the lack of a descended larynx does not necessarily equate to a reduced vowel capacity.[325] The 1983 discovery of a Neanderthal hyoid bone—used in speech production in humans—in Kebara 2 which is almost identical to that of humans suggests Neanderthals were capable of speech, and the ancestral Sima de los Huesos hominins had humanlike hyoid and ear bones, which could suggest the early evolution of the modern human vocal apparatus. However, the hyoid does not definitively provide insight into vocal tract anatomy.[64] Subsequent studies reconstruct the Neanderthal vocal apparatus as comparable to that of modern humans, with a similar vocal repertoire.[326] In 2015, Lieberman stated that Neanderthals were capable of syntactical language, although nonetheless incapable of mastering any human dialect.[327]
