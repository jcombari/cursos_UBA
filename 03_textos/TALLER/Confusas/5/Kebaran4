Situated in the Terminal Pleistocene, the Kebaran is classified as an Epipalaeolithic society.  They are generally thought to have been ancestral to the later Natufian culture that occupied much of the same range,[2] who advanced the use of wild grains, building on the Kebaran traits to acquire some symptoms of permanent settlements, agriculture, and hints of civilization.
