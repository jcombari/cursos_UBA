It is unclear when Neanderthals split from modern humans; studies have produced various intervals ranging from 315,000[21] to more than 800,000 years ago.[22] The time of divergence of Neanderthals from their ancestor H. heidelbergensis is also unclear. The oldest potential Neanderthal bones are dated to 430,000 years ago, but the classification is uncertain.[23] Neanderthals are known from numerous fossils, especially from after 130,000 years ago.[24] The type specimen, Neanderthal 1, was found in 1856 in the German Neander Valley. After much debate over their validity, Neanderthals were depicted as being primitive, stupid, and brutish for much of the early 20th century. Although knowledge and perception of them has markedly changed since then in the scientific community, the image of the unevolved caveman archetype remains prevalent in popular culture.[25][26]
