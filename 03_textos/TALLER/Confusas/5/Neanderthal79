Purported Neanderthal bone flute fragments made of bear long bones were reported from Potočka zijalka, Slovenia, in the 1920s, and Istállós-kői-barlang, Hungary,[291] and Mokriška jama, Slovenia, in 1985; but these are now attributed to modern human activities.[292][293] The 1995 43 thousand year old Divje Babe Flute from Slovenia has been attributed by some researchers to Neanderthals, and Canadian musicologist Robert Fink said the original flute had either a diatonic or pentatonic musical scale.[294] However, the date also overlaps with modern human immigration into Europe, which means it is also possible it was not manufactured by Neanderthals.[295] It has also been argued that it was not a flute at all, and the holes were made by a scavenging hyaena as there is a lack of cut marks stemming from whittling,[293] but it has also been argued that it is highly unlikely the punctures were made by teeth, and cut marks are not always present on bone flutes.[58]
