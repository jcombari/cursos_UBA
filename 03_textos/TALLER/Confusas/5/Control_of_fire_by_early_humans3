Use and control of fire was a gradual process, proceeding through more than one stage. One was a change in habitat, from dense forest, where wildfires were common, to savanna (mixed grass/woodland) where wildfires were of higher intensity.[citation needed] Such a change may have occurred about 3 Mya, when the savanna expanded in East Africa due to cooler and drier climate.[7][8]
