Rock art, including painting and engraving or carving (petroglyphs), can be found at sites throughout Australia. Examples of rock art have been found that are believed to depict extinct megafauna such as Genyornis[4] and Thylacoleo in the Pleistocene era[5] as well as more recent historical events such as the arrival of European ships.[6]
