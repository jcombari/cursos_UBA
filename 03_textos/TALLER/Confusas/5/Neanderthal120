The first evidence of Neanderthal/human contact was discovered in 2009 with a mandible belonging to a young Neanderthal from the modern-human-inhabited (indicated by Aurignacian technology) Grotte des Rois, France. The mandible shows cut marks which are similar to the butchery seen in the reindeer bones also in the cave, which could indicate human predation of Neanderthals, human skinning of Neanderthal heads (as trophies), or a pre-burial ritual involving tooth extraction. Pre-burial ritual is better supported as other Aurignacian sites have evidence of post-mortem tooth extraction (but for modern humans), perhaps to use as jewellery.[395]
