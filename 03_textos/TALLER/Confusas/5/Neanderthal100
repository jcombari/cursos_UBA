Neuroscientist Andrey Vyshedskiy argued that Neanderthals lacked mental synthesis, the behaviorally modern human imaginative ability to craft effectively infinite ideas using a finite amount of words. This is a hallmark of behavioural modernity, which he believed spontaneously appeared by about 70,000 years ago (the "Upper Palaeolithic Revolution").[333] However, behavioural modernity is regarded as a process initiated much earlier, potentially as early as 400,000 years ago,[334] and may have also been exhibited in Neanderthals.[335][329][54]
