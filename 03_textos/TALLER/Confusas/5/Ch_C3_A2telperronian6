Scholars who question its existence claim that it is an archaeological mix of Mousterian and Aurignacian layers.[5][6] The Châtelperronian industry may relate to the origins of the very similar Gravettian culture. French archaeologists have traditionally classified both cultures together under the name Périgordian, Early Perigordian being equivalent to the Châtelperronian and all the other phases corresponding to the Gravettian,[7][8][9] though this scheme is not often used by Anglophone authors.
