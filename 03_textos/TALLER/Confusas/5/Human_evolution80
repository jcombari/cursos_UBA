Some anthropologists and archaeologists subscribe to the Toba catastrophe theory, which posits that the supereruption of Lake Toba on Sumatran island in Indonesia some 70,000 years ago caused global consequences,[167] killing the majority of humans and creating a population bottleneck that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today.[168] The genetic and archaeological evidence for this remains in question however.[169]
