Neanderthal produced the adhesive birch bark tar, perhaps using plant-based resins for hafting.[317] It was long believed that birch bark tar required a complex recipe to be followed, and that it thus showed complex cognitive skills and cultural transmission. However, a 2019 study showed it can be made simply by burning birch bark on smooth vertical surfaces, such as a flat, inclined rock.[33]
