Detractors of the interbreeding model argue that the genetic similarity is only a remnant of a common ancestor instead of interbreeding,[376] although this is unlikely as it fails to explain why sub-Saharan Africans do not have Neanderthal DNA.[351] Anthropologist John D. Hawks has argued that the genetic similarity to Neanderthals may be the result of both common ancestry and interbreeding, as opposed to just one or the other.[377]
