Maximum natural lifespan and the timing of adulthood, menopause, and gestation were most likely very similar to modern humans.[161] However, it has been hypothesised that Neanderthals matured faster than modern humans based on the growth rates of teeth and tooth enamel,[201][202] although this is not backed up by age biomarkers.[77] The main differences in maturation are the atlas bone in the neck as well as the middle thoracic vertebrae fused about 2 years later in Neanderthals than in modern humans, but this was more likely caused by a difference in anatomy rather than growth rate.[203][204]
