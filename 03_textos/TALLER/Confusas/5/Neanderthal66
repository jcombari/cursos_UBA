At Cueva del Sidrón, Spain, Neanderthals likely cooked and possibly smoked food,[44] as well as used certain plants—such as yarrow and camomile—as flavouring,[43] although these plants may have instead been used for their medicinal properties.[38] At Gorham's Cave, Gibraltar, Neanderthals may have been roasting pinecones to access pine nuts.[50]
