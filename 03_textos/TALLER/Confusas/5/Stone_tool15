Eventually, more complex Mode 2 tools began to be developed through the Acheulean Industry, named after the site of Saint-Acheul in France. The Acheulean was characterised not by the core, but by the biface, the most notable form of which was the hand axe.[18] The Acheulean first appears in the archaeological record as early as 1.7Â million years ago in the West Turkana area of Kenya and contemporaneously in southern Africa.
