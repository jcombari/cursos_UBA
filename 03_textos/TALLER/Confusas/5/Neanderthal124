Their ultimate extinction coincides with Heinrich event 4, a period of intense cold and dry climate causing their preferred forest landscape to give way to steppeland, and later Heinrich events are also associated with massive cultural turnovers where European human populations collapsed.[16][17] This climate change may have depopulated several regions of Neanderthals, like previous cold spikes, but these areas were instead repopulated by immigrating humans, leading to Neanderthal extinction.[401] It has also been proposed that climate change was the primary driver, as their low population left them vulnerable to any environmental change, with even a small drop in survival or fertility rates possibly quickly leading to their extinction.[402] However, Neanderthals and their ancestors had survived through several glacial periods over the hundreds of thousands of years of European habitation.[245] It is also proposed that the Campanian Ignimbrite Eruption in Italy around 40,000 years ago, when Neanderthal populations may have already been dwindling from other factors, could have led to their final demise, and it produced a 2–4 °C cooling event for a year and acid rain for several more years.[18][403]
