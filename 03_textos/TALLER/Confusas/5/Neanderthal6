The total population remained low, proliferating weakly harmful genes,[73] and precluding effective long-distance networks. Nonetheless, there is evidence of regional cultures and thus regular communication between communities.[74][75] They may have frequented caves, and moved between caves seasonally.[76] Neanderthals lived in a high-stress environment with high trauma rates, and about 80% died before the age of 40.[77] Evidence for interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans was presented in the 2010 Neanderthal genome project's draft report.[78][79][80] It possibly occurred 316–219 thousand years ago,[81] but more likely 100,000 years ago and again after 65,000 years ago.[82] They also appear to have interbred with Denisovans, a different group of archaic humans, in Siberia.[83][84] Around 1–4% of genomes of Eurasians, Oceanians, Native Americans, and North Africans while the inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africans have either none or possibly about 0.3% Neanderthal genes. And about 20% of distinctly Neanderthal genes survive today.[85] Although many of the genes inherited from Neanderthals may have been detrimental and selected out,[73] Neanderthal introgression appears to have affected the modern human immune system,[86][87] and is also implicated in several other biological functions and structures,[88] but a large portion appears to be non-coding ("junk") DNA.[89]
