The debate on Neanderthal funerals has been active since the 1908 discovery of La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 in a small, nonnatural hole in a cave in southwestern France, very controversially postulated to have been buried in a symbolic fashion.[341][337][342] Another grave at Shanidar Cave, Iraq, was associated with the pollen of several flowers that may have been in bloom at the time of depositionâ€”yarrow, centaury, ragwort, grape hyacinth, joint pine, and hollyhock.[343] The medicinal properties of the plants led American archaeologist Ralph Solecki to claim that the man buried was some leader, healer, or shaman, and that "The association of flowers with Neanderthals adds a whole new dimension to our knowledge of his humanness, indicating that he had 'soul' ".[344] However, it is also possible the pollen was deposited by a small rodent after the man's death.[345]
