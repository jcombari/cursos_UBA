Fire was an important factor in expanding and developing societies of early hominids. One impact fire might have had was social stratification. Those who could make and wield fire had more power than those who could not, and may have, therefore, had a higher position in society.[28] The presence of fire also led to an increase in length of "daytime", and allowed more activity to occur in the night that was not previously possible.[42] Evidence of large hearths indicate that the majority of this nighttime activity was spent around the fire, contributing to social interactions among individuals.[43] This increased amount of social interaction is speculated to be important in the development of language, as it fostered more communication among individuals.[42]
