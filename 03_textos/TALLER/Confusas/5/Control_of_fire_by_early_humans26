At the Amudian site of Qesem Cave, near the city of Kfar Qasim, evidence exists of the regular use of fire from before 382,000 BP to around 200,000 BP at the end of Lower Pleistocene. Large quantities of burned bone and moderately heated soil lumps were found, and the cut marks found on the bones suggest that butchering and prey-defleshing took place near fireplaces.[23] In addition, hominins living in Qesem cave managed to heat their flint to varying temperatures before knapping it into different tools.[24]
