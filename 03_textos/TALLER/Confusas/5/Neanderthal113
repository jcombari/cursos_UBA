Sequencing of the genome of a Denisovan from Denisova Cave has shown that 17% of its genome derives from Neanderthals.[84]  This Neanderthal DNA more closely resembled that of a 120,000 year old Neanderthal bone from the same cave than that of Neanderthals from Vindija Cave, Croatia, or Mezmaiskaya Cave in the Caucasus, suggesting that interbreeding was local.[83]
