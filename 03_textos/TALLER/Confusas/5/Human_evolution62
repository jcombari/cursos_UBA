Although the narratives of human evolution are often contentious, several discoveries since 2010 show that human evolution should not be seen as a simple linear or branched progression, but a mix of related species.[93][3][4][5] In fact, genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages is the rule, not the exception, in human evolution.[2] Furthermore, it is argued that hybridization was an essential creative force in the emergence of modern humans.[2]
