Fire also played a major role in changing how food was obtained and consumed, primarily by the practice of cooking.  This caused a significant increase in meat consumption and calorie intake.[27]  In addition to cooking, it was soon discovered that meat could be dried through the use of fire, allowing it to be preserved for times in which harsh environmental conditions made hunting difficult.[28]  Fire was even used in manufacturing tools to be used for hunting and cutting meat.[29]  Hominids found that large fires had their uses, as well.  By starting wildfires, they were able to increase land fertility and clear large amounts of brush and trees to make hunting easier.[28]  As early they began to understand how to use fire, such a useful skill may have led to specialized  social roles through the separation of cooking from hunting.[30]
