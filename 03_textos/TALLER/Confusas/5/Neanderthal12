Hybridisation between Neanderthals and early modern humans had been suggested early on,[111] such as by English anthropologist Thomas Huxley in 1890,[112] Danish ethnographer Hans Peder Steensby in 1907,[113] and Coon in 1962.[114] In the early 2000s, supposed hybrid specimens were discovered: Lagar Velho 1[115][116][117][118] and Muierii 1.[119] However, similar anatomy could also have been caused by adapting to a similar environment rather than interbreeding.[89] Neanderthal admixture was found to be present in modern populations in 2010 with the mapping of the first Neanderthal genome sequence.[78] This was based on 3 specimens in Vindija Cave, Croatia, which contained almost 4% archaic DNA (allowing for near complete sequencing of the genome). However, there was approximately 1 error for every 200 letters (base pairs) based on the implausibly high mutation rate, probably due to the preservation of the sample. In 2012, British-American geneticist Graham Coop hypothesised that they instead found evidence of a different archaic human species interbreeding with modern humans, which was disproven in 2013 by the sequencing of a high-quality Neanderthal genome preserved in a toe bone from Denisova Cave, Siberia.[89]
