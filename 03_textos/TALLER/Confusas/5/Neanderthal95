Remains of Middle Palaeolithic stone tools on Greek islands indicate early seafaring by Neanderthals in the Ionian Sea possibly starting as far back as 200–150 thousand years ago. The oldest stone artefacts from Crete date to 130–107 thousand years ago, Cephalonia 125 thousand years ago, and Zakynthos 110–35 thousand years ago. If correct, they likely employed simple reed boats and made one-day crossings back and forth.[36] Other Mediterranean islands include Sardinia, Melos, Alonnisos,[37] and Naxos (although Naxos may have been connected to land),[321] and it is possible they crossed the Strait of Gibraltar.[37] Their ability to engineer these boats and navigate through open waters would speak to their advanced cognitive and technical skills.[37][321]
