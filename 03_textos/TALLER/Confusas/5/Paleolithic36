Early dogs were domesticated, sometime between 30,000 and 14,000 BP, presumably to aid in hunting.[46] However, the earliest instances of successful domestication of dogs may be much more ancient than this. Evidence from canine DNA collected by Robert K. Wayne suggests that dogs may have been first domesticated in the late Middle Paleolithic around 100,000 BP or perhaps even earlier.[47]
