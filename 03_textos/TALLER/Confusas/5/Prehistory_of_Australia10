Archaeological evidence indicates human habitation at the upper Swan River, Western Australia by about 40,000 years ago.[13] Tasmania, which was connected to the continent by a land bridge, was inhabited at least 30,000 years ago.[14][15] Others have claimed that some sites are up to 60,000 years old, but these claims are not universally accepted.[16] Palynological evidence from South Eastern Australia suggests an increase in fire activity dating from around 120,000 years ago. This has been interpreted as representing human activity, but the dating of the evidence has been strongly challenged.[17]
