Based on past estimates for interglacial durations of about 10,000 years, in the 1970s there was some concern that the next glacial period would be imminent. However, slight changes in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit around the Sun suggest a lengthy interglacial lasting about another 50,000 years.[40] 
Additionally, human impact is now seen as possibly extending what would already be an unusually long warm period.
Projection of the timeline for the next glacial maximum depend crucially on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Models assuming increased CO2 levels at 750 parts per million (ppm; current levels are at 407 ppm[41]) have estimated the persistence of the current interglacial period for another 50,000 years.[42] However, more recent studies concluded that the amount of heat trapping gases emitted into Earth's oceans and atmosphere will prevent the next glacial (ice age), which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years, and likely more glacial cycles.[43][44]
