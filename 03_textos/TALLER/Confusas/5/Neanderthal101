Claims that Neanderthals held funerals for their dead with symbolic meaning[336] are heavily contested and speculative.[337][338][339] Although Neanderthals did bury their dead, at least occasionally—which may explain the abundance of fossil remains—[52] it is not indicative of a religious belief of life after death, as such burial could have also had non-symbolic motivations, such as great emotion[340] or to prevent scavenging.[333]
