Given high trauma rates and evidence of healing, Neanderthals appear to have been well-equipped at handling severe injuries. Well-healed fractures on many bones indicate the setting of splints. Individuals with severe head and rib traumas (which would have caused massive blood loss) indicate they had some manner of dressing major wounds, and bandages could have been made from animal skin. By-and-large, they appear to have avoided severe infections, indicating good long-term treatment of such wounds.[41]
