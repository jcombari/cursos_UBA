Hunter-gatherers tend to have an egalitarian social ethos,[20] although settled hunter-gatherers (for example, those inhabiting the Northwest Coast of North America) are an exception to this rule.[21][22] Nearly all African hunter-gatherers are egalitarian, with women roughly as influential and powerful as men.[23] For example, the San people or "Bushmen" of southern Africa have social customs that strongly discourage hoarding and displays of authority, and encourage economic equality via sharing of food and material goods.[24] Karl Marx defined this socio-economic system as primitive communism.[25]
