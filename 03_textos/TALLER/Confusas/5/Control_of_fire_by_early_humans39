The supporting evidence of the cooking hypothesis argues that compared to the nutrients in the raw food, nutrients in cooked food are much easier to digest for hominids as shown in the research of protein ingestion from raw vs. cooked egg.[47] Such a feature is essential for brain evolution; through studying the metabolic activities between primate species, scientists had found that  a limitation of energy harvesting through food sources exists due to shorted dats without fire.[48]
