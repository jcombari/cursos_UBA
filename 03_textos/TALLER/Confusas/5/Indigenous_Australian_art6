Gwion Gwion rock art (the "Bradshaw rock paintings", also referred to as Giro Giro"[3]), initially named after Joseph Bradshaw, who first reported them in 1891, consists of a series of rock paintings on caves in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.[8]  A 2020 study puts this art at about 12,000 years old.[9][10]
