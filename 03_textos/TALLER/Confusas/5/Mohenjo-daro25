The Mohenjo-daro site was further threatened in January 2014, when Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the Pakistan People's Party chose the site for Sindh Festival's inauguration ceremony. This would have exposed the site to mechanical operations, including excavation and drilling. Farzand Masih, head of the Department of Archaeology at Punjab University warned that such activity was banned under the Antiquity Act, saying "You cannot even hammer a nail at an archaeological site."  On 31 January 2014, a case was filed in the Sindh High Court to bar the Sindh government from continuing with the event.[46][47] The festival was held by PPP at the historic site, despite all the protest by both national and international historians and educators.
