Suggested contributory causes for the localisation of the IVC include changes in the course of the river,[211] and climate change that is also signalled for the neighbouring areas of the Middle East.[212][213] As of 2016[update] many scholars believe that drought, and a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia, caused the collapse of the Indus Civilisation.[214] The climate change which caused the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation was possibly due to "an abrupt and critical mega-drought and cooling 4,200Â years ago," which marks the onset of the Meghalayan Age, the present stage of the Holocene.[215]
