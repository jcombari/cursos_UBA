The term 'neolithic revolution' was coined by V. Gordon Childe in his 1936 book Man Makes Himself.[12][13] Childe introduced the concept as the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in Middle Eastern history.[citation needed] The period is described as a "revolution" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.[citation needed]
