It was also once thought that Neanderthals ritually hunted, killed, and cannibalised other Neanderthals and used the skull as the focus of some ceremony.[265] In 1962, Italian palaeontologist Alberto Blanc believed a skull from Grotta Guattari, Italy, had evidence of a swift blow to the head—indicative of ritual murder—and a precise and deliberate incising at the base to access the brain. He compared it to the victims of headhunters in Malaysia and Borneo,[347] putting it forward as evidence of a skull cult.[340] However, it is now thought to have been a result of cave hyaena predation.[348] Alhough Neanderthals are known to have practiced cannibalism, there is unsubstantial evidence to suggest ritual defleshing.[264]
