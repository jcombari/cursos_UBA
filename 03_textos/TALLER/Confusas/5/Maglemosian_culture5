Huts made of bark have been preserved, in addition to tools made of flint, bone, and horn. A characteristic of the culture are the sharply edged microliths of flintstone, used for spear and arrow heads.[4] Another notable feature is the leister, a characteristic type of fishing spear, used for gigging.
