Archaeological evidence from the Dordogne region of France demonstrates that members of the European early Upper Paleolithic culture known as the Aurignacian used calendars (c. 30,000 BP). This was a lunar calendar that was used to document the phases of the moon. Genuine solar calendars did not appear until the Neolithic.[48] Upper Paleolithic cultures were probably able to time the migration of game animals such as wild horses and deer.[49] This ability allowed humans to become efficient hunters and to exploit a wide variety of game animals.[49] Recent research indicates that the Neanderthals timed their hunts and the migrations of game animals long before the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic.[41]
