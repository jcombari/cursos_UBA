The spread of grasslands and open steppe with increasingly colder climate possibly favoured humans over Neanderthals.[15][54] Modern humans may have been able to push into colder areas with bigger game wearing their fitted clothes, which were more effective at insulating than Neanderthal ponchos;[398] however, sewing needles do not appear in the European archaeological record until the Gravettian after 30,000 years ago.[399] Raw material and animal remain sourcing in the southern Caucasus suggest that modern humans were able to use extensive social networks to acquire resources from a greater area in leaner times, whereas Neanderthals likely restricted themselves to more local sources since most of their stone artefacts were drawn from within 5 km (3.1 mi).[31][400] Modern humans appear to have used more complex food extraction methods, whereas Neanderthals gathered what was abundant. Consequently, in especially lean times, any competition may have been devastating on relict Neanderthal communities.[245][52] The stalled lithic technology of Neanderthals could indicate a lower capacity for inventiveness, which would have put them at a disadvantage against modern humans in a changing environment.[52]
