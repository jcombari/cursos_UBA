In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in Vashtëmi, southeastern Albania and dating back to 6500 BC.[35][36] In Northwest Europe it is much later, typically lasting just under 3,000 years from c. 4500 BC–1700 BC.
