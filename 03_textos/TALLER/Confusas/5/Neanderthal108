However, due to their small population and resulting reduced effectivity of natural selection, Neanderthals accumulated several weakly harmful mutations, which were introduced to and slowly selected out of the much larger human population; the initial hybridised population may have experienced up to a 94% reduction in fitness compared to contemporary humans. By this measure, Neanderthals may have substantially increased in fitness.[73]  A 2017 study focusing on archaic genes in Turkey found associations with coeliac disease, malaria severity, and Costello syndrome.[362] Nonetheless, some genes may have helped modern human Europeans adapt to the environment; the Val92Met variant of the MC1R gene, which may be weakly associated with red hair,[363] may descend from Neanderthals[364] although this is contested as the variant was rare in Neanderthals,[197] and light skin in modern humans did not become prevalent until the Holocene.[198] Some genes related to the immune system appear to have been affected by introgression, which may have aided migration,[87] such as OAS1,[365] STAT2,[366] TLR6, TLR1, TLR10,[367] and several related to immune response.[86][f] In addition, Neanderthal genes have also been implicated in the structure and function of the brain,[g] keratin filaments, sugar metabolism, muscle contraction, body fat distribution, enamel thickness, and oocyte meiosis.[88] Nonetheless, a large portion of surviving introgression appears to be non-coding ("junk") DNA with few biological functions.[89]
