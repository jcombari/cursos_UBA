By 2002, over 1,000 Mature Harappan cities and settlements had been reported, of which just under a hundred had been excavated,[11][f][12][13][g] However, there are only fiveÂ major urban sites:[14][h] Harappa, Mohenjo-daro (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Dholavira, Ganeriwala in Cholistan, and Rakhigarhi.[15][i] The early Harappan cultures were preceded by local Neolithic agricultural villages, from which the river plains were populated.[16][17]
