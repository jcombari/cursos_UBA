The warming trend following the Last Glacial Maximum, since about 20,000 years ago, has resulted in a sea level rise by about 130 metres.
This warming trend subsided about 6,000 years ago, and sea level has been comparatively stable since the Neolithic.
The present interglacial period (the Holocene climatic optimum) has been fairly stable and warm, but the previous one was interrupted by numerous cold spells lasting hundreds of years. If the previous period was more typical than the present one, the period of stable climate,  which allowed the Neolithic Revolution and by extension human civilization, 
may have been possible only because of a highly unusual period of stable temperature.[36]
