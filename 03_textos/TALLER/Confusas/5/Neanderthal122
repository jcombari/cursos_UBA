Although modern human expansion and Neanderthal contraction are correlated, this may instead be due to the competitive exclusion principle with modern humans outcompeting and outperforming Neanderthals rather than exterminating them.[13] However, largely human-free tropical Asia was colonised by modern humans by 60,000 years ago, meaning European colonisation was, for some reason, delayed, and, although colder climate may have influenced immigration speed, it is possible the presence of Neanderthal settlements inhibited modern human expansion for some time.[397]
