Neanderthals likely lived in more sparsely distributed groups than contemporary modern humans,[161] but group size is thought to have averaged 10 to 30 individuals, similar to modern hunter-gatherers.[31] Reliable evidence of Neanderthal group composition comes from Cueva del Sidr√≥n, Spain, and the footprints at Le Rozel, France:[171] the former shows 7 adults, 3 adolescents, 2 juveniles, and an infant;[224] whereas the latter, based on footprint size, shows a group of 10 to 13 members where juveniles and adolescents made up 90%.[171]
