The degree of language complexity is difficult to establish, but given that Neanderthals achieved some technical and cultural complexity, and interbred with humans, it is reasonable to assume they were at least fairly articulate, comparable to modern humans. A somewhat complex language—possibly using syntax—was likely necessary to survive in their harsh environment, with Neanderthals needing to communicate about topics such as locations, hunting and gathering, and tool-making techniques.[63][328][329] The FOXP2 gene in modern humans is associated with speech and language development. FOXP2 was present in Neanderthals,[330] but not the gene's modern human variant.[331] Neurologically, Neanderthals had an expanded Broca's area—operating the formulation of sentences, and speech comprehension—but 11 out of 48 genes which encode for language brainwaves had different methylation patterns between Neanderthals and modern humans. This could indicate a stronger ability in modern humans than in Neanderthals to express language.[332]
