Elaborate headdresses or dhari (also spelt dari[37]), as featuried on the Torres Strait Islander Flag, are created for the purposes of ceremonial dances.[38] The dari was historically worn by Torres Strait warriors in battle. It is seen as a powerful symbol of the Torres Strait Islander people, today representing peace and harmony. World-renowned artist Ken Thaiday Snr has created elaborate dharis using modern materials in his contemporary artwork.[39]
