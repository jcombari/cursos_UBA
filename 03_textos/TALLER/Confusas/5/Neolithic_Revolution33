The first agricultural center in northern China is believed to be the homelands of the early Sino-Tibetan-speakers, associated with the Houli, Peiligang, Cishan, and Xinglongwa cultures, clustered around the Yellow River basin.[60][61] It was the domestication center for foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) with evidence of domestication of these species approximately 8,000 years ago.[62] These species were subsequently widely cultivated in the Yellow River basin (7,500 years ago).[62] Soybean was also domesticated in northern China 4,500 years ago.[63] Orange and peach also originated in China. They were cultivated around 2500 BCE.[64][65]
