Anthropologists maintain that hunter-gatherers do not have permanent leaders; instead, the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed.[29][30][31] In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies, there is often, though not always, sexual parity as well.[29] Hunter-gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band (or tribe) membership.[32] Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal, at least initially.[33] Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers, who continue living nearby in the same camp.[34] The systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible, although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal.[35]
