The lack of sunlight most likely led to the proliferation of lighter skin in Neanderthals,[197] although light skin in modern Europeans was not particularly prolific until perhaps the Bronze Age.[198] Genetically, BNC2 was present in Neanderthals, which is associated with light skin colour; however, a second variation of BNC2 was also present, which is associated with darker skin colour in the UK Biobank.[197] It is likely Neanderthal skin colour varied from region to region. The DNA of three Croatian Neanderthals shows they had darker hair, skin, and eye colour than modern Europeans.[199]
