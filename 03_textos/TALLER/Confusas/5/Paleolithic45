Lower Paleolithic Acheulean tool users, according to Robert G. Bednarik, began to engage in symbolic behavior such as art around 850,000Â BP. They decorated themselves with beads and collected exotic stones for aesthetic, rather than utilitarian qualities.[72] According to him, traces of the pigment ochre from late Lower Paleolithic Acheulean archaeological sites suggests that Acheulean societies, like later Upper Paleolithic societies, collected and used ochre to create rock art.[72] Nevertheless, it is also possible that the ochre traces found at Lower Paleolithic sites is naturally occurring.[73]
