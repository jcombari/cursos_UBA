The Latin noun homō (genitive hominis) means "human being" or "man" in the generic sense of "human being, mankind".[a] The binomial name Homo sapiens was coined by Carl Linnaeus (1758).[13][b] Names for other species of the genus were introduced beginning in the second half of the 19th century (H. neanderthalensis 1864, H. erectus 1892).
