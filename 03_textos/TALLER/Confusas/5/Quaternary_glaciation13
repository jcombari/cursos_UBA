The role of Earth's orbital changes in controlling climate was first advanced by James Croll in the late 19th century.[9] Later, Milutin MilankoviÄ‡, a Serbian geophysicist, elaborated on the theory and calculated that these irregularities in Earth's orbit could cause the climatic cycles now known as Milankovitch cycles.[10] They are the result of the additive behavior of several types of cyclical changes in Earth's orbital properties.
