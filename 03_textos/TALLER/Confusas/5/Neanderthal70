There are several instances of Neanderthals practising cannibalism across their range.[264][265] The first example came from Krapina, Croatia, in 1899,[109] and other examples were found at Cueva del Sidr√≥n[233] and Zafarraya in Spain; and the French Grotte de Moula-Guercy,[266] Les Pradelles, and La Quina. For the five cannibalised Neanderthals at the Grottes de Goyet, Belgium, there is evidence that the upper limbs were disarticulated, the lower limbs defleshed and also smashed (likely to extract bone marrow), the chest cavity disemboweled, and the jaw dismembered. There is also evidence that the butchers used some bones to retouch their tools. The processing of Neanderthal meat at Grottes de Goyet is similar to how they processed horse and reindeer.[264][265] About 35% of the Neanderthals at Marillac-le-Franc, France, show clear signs of butchery, and the presence of digested teeth indicates that the bodies were abandoned and eaten by scavengers, likely hyaenas.[267]
