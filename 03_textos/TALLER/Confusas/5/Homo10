From the late-19th to mid-20thÂ centuries, a number of new taxonomic names including new generic names were proposed for early human fossils; most have since been merged with Homo in recognition that Homo erectus was a single species with a large geographic spread of early migrations. Many such names are now dubbed as "synonyms" with Homo, including Pithecanthropus,[18] Protanthropus,[19] Sinanthropus,[20] Cyphanthropus,[21] Africanthropus,[22] Telanthropus,[23] Atlanthropus,[24] and Tchadanthropus.[25][26]
