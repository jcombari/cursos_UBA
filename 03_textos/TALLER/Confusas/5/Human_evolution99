However, there is an ongoing debate over whether H. floresiensis is indeed a separate species.[209] Some scientists hold that H. floresiensis was a modern H. sapiens with pathological dwarfism.[210] This hypothesis is supported in part, because some modern humans who live on Flores, the Indonesian island where the skeleton was found, are pygmies. This, coupled with pathological dwarfism, could have resulted in a significantly diminutive human. The other major attack on H. floresiensis as a separate species is that it was found with tools only associated with H. sapiens.[210]
