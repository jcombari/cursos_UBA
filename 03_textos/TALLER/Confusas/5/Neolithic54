Most clothing appears to have been made of animal skins, as indicated by finds of large numbers of bone and antler pins that are ideal for fastening leather. Wool cloth and linen might have become available during the later Neolithic,[72][73] as suggested by finds of perforated stones that (depending on size) may have served as spindle whorls or loom weights.[74][75][76] The clothing worn in the Neolithic Age might be similar to that worn by Ã–tzi the Iceman, although he was not Neolithic (since he belonged to the later Copper Age).
