Neanderthals (/niˈændərtɑːl, neɪ-, -θɔːl/,[7] also Neandertals, Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens neanderthalensis)[8] are an extinct species or subspecies of archaic humans who lived in Eurasia until about 40,000 years ago.[9][10][11][12] They most likely went extinct due to competition with, or extermination by, immigrating European early modern humans[13][14][15] or due to great climatic change,[16][17][18] disease,[19][20] or a combination of these factors.[18]
