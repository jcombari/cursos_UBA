The next stage involved interaction with burned landscapes and foraging in the wake of wildfires, as observed in various wild animals.[7][8] In the African savanna, animals that preferentially forage in recently burned areas include savanna chimpanzees (a variety of Pan troglodytes verus),[7][9] vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops)[10] and a variety of birds, some of which also hunt insects and small vertebrates in the wake of grass fires.[9][11]
